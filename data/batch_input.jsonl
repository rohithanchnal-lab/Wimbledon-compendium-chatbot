He was working on the \n2018 edition when he died in 2017. I hope Alan would be proud of how the \nCompendium has continued to develop with each new Championships.\nIt is almost impossible to publish a book on Wimbledon history without in some way \nrelying on the expertise of John Barrett, author of Wimbledon: The Official History. John\u2019s \nwisdom and support have been invaluable over the years. \nIan Hewitt, former Chairman of the All England Club, has also provided great support \nand his work in promoting the heritage of the Club and the sport of tennis simply cannot \nbe overstated.\nThe work of compiling the Compendium every year involves liaising with many \ndifferent colleagues, all of whom provide vital updates to the book. It is impossible to list \neveryone who has contributed information over the past 34 years, but I would like to \nthank the following colleagues who provided updates for this edition:\nDan Ashmore, Dan Bloxham, Lizzie Bloxham, Dominic Brook, Fiona Canning, Ben \nClark, Matt Crawcour, Paul Davies, Jo Debs, Pete Dobson, Kate Duxberry, Preyan De Silva, \nCatherine Edser, Luke Ellis, Martyn Falconer, Camilla Fellows, Sarah Frandsen, Joe Furber, \nSarah Goldson, Georgina Green, Sarah Hames, Carole Hewitt, Ulrika Hogberg, Michal \nJenicek, Bill Jinks, Sarah Johnson, Briony Lammas, Sam McQueen, James Mendelssohn, \nKelly O\u2019Brien, Ella Ottaway, Denise Parnell, Joanna Radomska, Julia Richardson, Ella \nSargent, Joanne Simons, Alexandra Singer, Lucy Smith, Rachel Swithinbank, Adam \nThomas, Sarah Vergunst, Maggie Weiss, Tristan Wesley and Andy Wynne. \nA special thank you this year to Malin Lundin, who has done an excellent job of \nrevising the Trophies section.\nAs always, the efforts of Eloise Tyson are greatly appreciated for her proofreading and \nediting of the many revised sections. \nSeveral people outside the AEL TC have made invaluable contributions, most notably \nthe late Ben Chatfield, who helped to re-write several chapters when the format of the \nbook changed in 2019, and Paul Newman, whose annual preview articles have become a \nkey component of the Compendium for the past seven years. The illustrations of Zebedee \nHelm are also a much-enjoyed addition to the book.\nI am also grateful for the input of several independent tennis historians. The expertise \nof Bob Everitt, Richard Hillway and Attila Szabo has been invaluable over many years but \nthis year I would especially like to thank Richard Sinclair, who has provided several \nfascinating new pieces of information on a variety of topics, including Royalty at \nWimbledon, rackets used by champions, ambidextrous players and female officials. \nLast but not least, a big thank you to Ed Davis, Jim Drewett and all the team at our \npublisher, Vision Sports Publishing. They not only do a wonderful job of putting the \nCompendium together every year and getting it ready in time for each Championships, \nbut they are also a pleasure to work with.\nRobert McNicol\nMay 2025"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

In 1946, \nafter listening to the Gentlemen\u2019s \nSingles final on the radio, Alan \ndecided to come to Wimbledon \nhimself the next day, to watch the \nLadies\u2019 final between Pauline Betz \nand Louise Brough. Thus began a \nlifelong love affair between Alan \nand Wimbledon. He missed the \n1947 Championships whilst on \nNational Service but returned the \nfollowing year for his first of 70 \nconsecutive Championships.\nAlan had a \u2018real\u2019 job working \nfor British Telecom (BT) but \nhis main passion in life was \ntennis. From a young age, he \nloved to collect tennis books \nand magazines and to study the \nhistory of the game. One of his \nearliest contributions to tennis \nliterature was when he wrote \na letter to the editor of Lawn \nTennis and Badminton magazine, \npointing out an error in an article by Lance Tingay, one of the pre-eminent tennis writers \nof the time. This was typical Alan. Accuracy and attention to detail were the foundations of \neverything he did.\nBy 1960 Alan had become a regular contributor to Lawn Tennis and Badminton and \nwas already described in the magazine as \u2018a keen British lawn tennis historical authority.\u2019 \nIn 1967, when Lawn Tennis and Badminton became Tennis Pictorial International, Alan \nwas Assistant Editor. He continued in this role when Tennis Pictorial International was \nsucceeded by Tennis World in 1969 and, later that year, Alan became editor, a job he \ncontinued to do until 1976. By this time, he had been tasked with setting up a library in \nthe new Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum. Nevertheless, he continued his association \nwith Tennis World, in the capacity of Consulting Editor, until 1981.\nWhen The All England Lawn Tennis Club decided to build a Museum and Library,  \nAlan was the obvious choice to run the Library. After all, it had been his idea in the first \nplace. In his March 1967 column in Lawn Tennis and Badminton, Alan proposed that a \nNational Museum and Library of Lawn Tennis be built on land recently acquired by the \nClub: \u201cThe library section would probably be of more material value to the tennis lover,\u201d  \nhe wrote. \u201cBelieve me, information on the Game\u2019s history is hard to come by.\u201d\nAbove: Alan Little M.B.E., 1928\u20132017\nWIMBLEDON COMPENDIUM 202 512"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Alan was particularly \nproud of the Library\u2019s magazine collection and he had a special talent for tracking down rare \nsets of magazines and persuading their owners to donate them to the Library.\nInitially, Alan combined his role of Honorary Librarian with his full-time job at BT . \nHowever, in 1983 he took early retirement and was now free to concentrate on his passion \nfor tennis. By the 1990s he had settled into the weekly pattern that he maintained for the \nrest of his life. He would attend the Library every Tuesday and Thursday, almost without \nfail, except during The Championships when he would be there every day. His time in the \nLibrary would be spent working on The Compendium, as well as his many other books, \nand answering enquiries from fellow tennis researchers. Over the years, Alan helped \ncountless people and made many friends from all over the world, all of whom revered Alan \nfor the quality of his research. He himself enjoyed nothing more than being able to help \nanyone who shared his thirst for tennis knowledge.\nAs well as helping others with their research, Alan wrote many books of his own. His \nfirst publication was The Changing Face of Wimbledon 1877-1977, one of a set of booklets \npublished to mark the centenary of The Championships. This publication was the forerunner \nof a popular \u2018trilogy\u2019 of booklets, first published in 2002, that describe the evolution of the \nClub and its Grounds: Wimbledon 1869-1921: The Changing Face of Worple Road, Wimbledon \n1922: The New Ground and Centre Court, and Wimbledon 1922-2002: The Changing Face of \nChurch Road. The latter was updated several times, most recently in 2014.\nIn 1980 he edited Know Your Wimbledon, a booklet that was sold alongside the Official \nProgramme. The following year, the booklet was relaunched as This is Wimbledon and Alan \ncontinued to edit it every year until 2013. He was also responsible for compiling the first \nLawn Tennis Championships Media Guide, a task he continued to do until 1990.\nBetween 1983 and 1985 Alan wrote a series of booklets on early Wimbledon \nChampions Lottie Dodd, Maud Watson, Kathleen Godfree, May Sutton, Dorothea \nChambers and Lena Rice, as well as one telling the story of Vere St. Leger Goold, the 1879 \nAll Comers\u2019 Runner-up, who was later convicted of murder. The book was drily entitled, A \nTale of Two Courts, a title Alan often expressed great amusement in having thought up.\nAlan\u2019s first book was published in 1984. Wimbledon Ladies: A Centenary Record 1884-\n1984 \u2013 The Singles Champions was co-written with Lance Tingay. This was followed two \nyears later by Wimbledon Men: A Hundred Championships 1877-1987 \u2013 The Singles Champions, \nalso written with Tingay, who produced essays on each Champion whilst Alan provided the \nstatistics on their playing records and career achievements. Both books were updated four \ntimes, most recently in 2015, with John Barrett continuing Tingay\u2019s work as co-author.\nAlan\u2019s first solo book was published in 1988. Suzanne Lenglen \u2013 Tennis Idol of the \nTwenties told the story of one of Alan\u2019s all-time favourite players, the six-time Wimbledon \nsingles Champion whom he described as doing \u2018much to popularise the game as it is today\u2019. \nA much-expanded version of this book was published in 2007 and listed the results of \nnearly every match played by Lenglen during her career.\nAnother of Alan\u2019s areas of interest was reflected in his next book, Tennis and the Olympic \nGames, which reviewed every Olympic tennis tournament from Athens 1896 through to \nBeijing 2008, complete with results of every match in Olympic history. After the London \n2012 Games, Alan brought the Olympic tennis story up to date by publishing a booklet, \nThe Olympic Tennis Event at Wimbledon 2012, which told the story of Andy Murray\u2019s \nhistoric victory for Great Britain.\nIN MEMORIAM 13"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

First published in 1991, it consisted of a relatively modest 216 pages. For the \nnext 27 years, Alan would update the book with meticulous attention to detail, regularly \nadding new categories of information. He did wonder occasionally if he\u2019d gone too far: \n\u201cI\u2019ve created a monster!\u201d he once exclaimed, when faced with the task of updating one of \nthe more complicated sections. But, most of the time, Alan was never more content than \nwhen sitting in the Library on a Tuesday or Thursday, updating his Compendium.\nAlthough Alan liked his expertise to be appreciated, he never wanted to be the centre of \nattention and never sought recognition for the work he did.\nFor him, being able to do something he loved was reward in itself. Nevertheless, Alan \ndeservedly received many awards for his unique contribution to tennis, including an \nM.B.E. in 2014, the Lawn Tennis Writers Association\u2019s Annual Award in 2008 and the \nAll England Club\u2019s Distinguished Service Award in 2016.

As he once said: \u201cThe only way to become an \nHonorary Member is to win Wimbledon or start a Library!\u201d\nFor a man of 89 years, Alan was incredibly sprightly and everyone who worked with \nhim was awe of his energy and enthusiasm.

Two prizes will be given \u2013 one gold champion prize \nto the winner and silver to the second player.\u201d\nFrom the distance of almost a century and a half that simple \nannouncement in The Field conceals an almost unbelievable story, \nand those of us who take for granted the universal appeal of The \nChampionships at Wimbledon with their 14 days of unparalleled \nskill and excitement each year \u2013 witnessed by some half-a-\nmillion spectators at the famous grounds in Church Road and \nby a potential television audience of more than one billion \nviewers in almost 200 territories around the world \u2013 sometimes \nfind it hard to believe that things were not always like this.\nThe story begins on 23 July 1868 when John H. Walsh, Capt. \nR.F. Dalton, J. Hinde Hale, the Revd. A. Law, S.H. Clarke Maddock \nand Walter Jones Whitmore met in the offices of Herbert Cox, the \npublisher of The Field, at 346 Strand in London, and the All England \nCroquet Club was founded. The following summer, the Club organised \nits first croquet championship, held on a cricket ground at Crystal Palace. \nIn October 1869, a ground of four acres in Wimbledon\u2019s Nursery Lane (now Nursery \nRoad), between Worple Road and the London and South Western Railway, was rented for \na period of three years at annual rents of \u00a350, \u00a375 and \u00a3100. Annual subscriptions for Club \nMembers were set at \u00a31.1s. for a gentleman or lady and \u00a31.11s.6d. for a husband and wife. \nThe ground was laid out in three terraces and opened in May. A pavilion was erected and in \nJune 1870 a croquet championship was held at the Club\u2019s ground.\nBut by 1875 interest in croquet had waned and so had the Club\u2019s finances. The \nCommittee, looking to revive the fortunes of the Club, announced that one croquet lawn \nwould be set apart for playing lawn tennis, a new game introduced to the public by Major \nWingfield in 1874 that was sweeping the country. Games were played in accordance with a \ncode of laws for lawn tennis issued on 24 May by the Marylebone Cricket Club. \nSuch was the popularity of the new game, the following year an entire terrace of four \ncroquet lawns was made over to lawn tennis and in April 1877 the Club was re-named  \n\u2018The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\u2019. Two months later the Committee \ndecided to institute the first Lawn Tennis Championship \u2013 a gentlemen\u2019s singles event \u2013 \nand an announcement of such was published in The Field. \nNot only would this event become the world\u2019s first tennis championship, the laws \ndrawn up by a sub-committee of three All England Club members \n\u2013 Henry Jones, who would serve as the Referee at the first \nChampionship, Julian Marshall and Charles Heathcote \u2013 \neffectively formed the long-term basis of the game as we \nknow it today.\nIncluded in the Club\u2019s new set of laws was the stipulation \nthat the rectangular court should be set at 26 yards by nine \nyards (which have remained the dimensions into the modern \nday).

The \nreal tennis form of scoring \n\u2013 15, 30, 40, deuce and \nadvantage \u2013 was adopted \nover the more commonly \nused rackets method of \nscoring of 15 points up, \nwhich the MCC had \nrecommended from the \nstart, with the decision \nalso made that the \nserver should have two \nchances on each point \nto deliver a fair serve. \nIt was also determined \nthat \u2018sudden death\u2019 \nwould occur at five-\ngames-all and that \nplayers would change \nends between sets. \nThere were 22 entries for the first Championship, which was only open \nto gentlemen, and, as if to reinforce the relatively lowly initial status of the event in the \nLondon sporting hierarchy, no play was scheduled for the Friday or Saturday of that week in \norder not to clash with the Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord\u2019s. \nWithin three years, however, grandstands had been purchased to accommodate the \ngrowing crowds at the annual event, by 1881 the Club had raised enough funds to purchase \nthe Worple Road ground and the following year croquet ceased to be played and the Club \nwas renamed the \u2018All England Lawn Tennis Club\u2019.\nNow, of course, the names of the \u2018All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club\u2019 (Croquet \nas a sport was reintroduced in 1957, although the sport had returned to the club\u2019s name \nin 1899) and \u2018Wimbledon\u2019 are famous the world over and synonymous with one of the \nworld\u2019s greatest and most popular sporting events.

For the best part of two decades men\u2019s \ntennis was dominated by the so-called \u2018Big Four\u2019, but after Rafael \nNadal and Andy Murray followed Roger Federer into retirement \nlast year, Novak Djokovic is the last active player left of the four who  \nwon every gentlemen\u2019s singles title at The Championships between  \n2003 and 2022.\nWith two recent Wimbledon Ladies\u2019 Singles Champions, Angelique Kerber and Simona \nHalep, having also announced their retirements since last summer, this year\u2019s \nChampionships will demonstrate how much the sport\u2019s landscape is changing. A new wave \nof talent has emerged, headed by the likes of Mirra Andreeva, Alexandra Eala, Diana \nShnaider, Jack Draper, Jakub Mensik and Ben Shelton.\nThere is nothing new about teenaged champions in women\u2019s tennis \u2013 Martina Hingis and \nMaria Sharapova for example won Wimbledon at 16 and 17 respectively \u2013 but as players \nhave become fitter and stronger it has become increasingly difficult for younger generations \nto make an impact. At the start of this year Andreeva was the only teenager in the world\u2019s \ntop 100, which makes her achievements all the more remarkable \u2013 she only turned 18 in \nApril, having just won two of the biggest tournaments on the Women\u2019s Tennis Association \ntour at Dubai and Indian Wells, which took her into the world\u2019s top 10. Might the ultimate \nprize now be within her reach? It should help that she is coached by someone who knows \nwhat it takes to win Wimbledon, Conchita Martinez having claimed the All England Club \ntitle in 1994. Andreeva, who played in her first Grand Slam semi-final at Roland-Garros \nlast summer, has already proved her aptitude for grass, having reached the fourth round on \nher Championships debut two years ago.\nWhat of the other young women who have been breaking through? Eala, who turned 20 \nin May, has taken longer than Andreeva to make an impact but enjoyed a remarkable run to \nthis year\u2019s semi-finals in Miami, where she beat three Grand Slam champions in Jelena \nOstapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek. Shnaider, who turned 21 in April this year, \nmade the world\u2019s top 20 during her breakthrough season in 2024, winning four tournaments \nalong the way, including the grass court event at Bad Homburg. Meanwhile Maya Joint, \naged 19, and Polina Kudermetova, aged 22, are set for their Championships debuts after \nmaking significant progress this year, while 20-year-old Linda Noskova and 21-year-old \nAshlyn Krueger are among others with great potential.\nThe first 17 years of the 20th century saw Serena and Venus Williams dominate at The \nChampionships, winning the ladies\u2019 singles title 12 times between them, but the last eight \neditions have been won by eight different players. Five have since retired (Serena Williams, \nGarbi\u00f1e Muguruza, Kerber, Halep and Ashleigh Barty), while the last three champions have \nall been ranked outside the world\u2019s top 20: Elena Rybakina was world No.23, Marketa \nVondrousova No.42 and Barbora Krejcikova No.32. Rybakina went on to reach the quarter-\nfinals in 2023 and the semi-finals last year, but Vondrousova became only the second \ndefending Ladies\u2019 Singles Champion (after Steffi Graf in 1994) to go out in the first round \nwhen she lost to Jessica Bouzas Maneiro last summer. Krejcikova has been dogged by a back \ninjury this year.\nRecent Wimbledons might suggest the ladies\u2019 singles will be as open as ever this summer, \nbut Aryna Sabalenka, semi-finalist in her last two appearances at the All England Club and \nworld No.1 for most of the last year, will be hoping not to feature in any upsets. Going into \nRoland-Garros, the 27-year-old had made the quarter-finals or better in each of her \nprevious nine Grand Slam appearances. Iga Swiatek, who was dislodged from the top of the \nworld rankings last year by Sabalenka, has been dominant on clay in recent years, but has \nrarely found her best form at The Championships.

In \nhis very first appearance at the All England Club the Frenchman became just the seventh \nman in history to hit 50 or more aces in a match as he knocked out the No.20 seed, \nSebastian Korda.\nArthur Fils, another 21-year-old Frenchman, broke into the world\u2019s top 20 at the end of \n2024 and should go into The Championships full of confidence after reaching the fourth \nround last year, while Holger Rune, a 22-year-old Dane, has already appeared in a \nChampionships quarter-final. As for the \u2018Next Gen\u2019 group of players, the likes of Daniil \nMedvedev, Alexander Zverev and Stefanos Tsitsipas might be wondering whether their \nWimbledon chances are starting to fade.\nIn Murray\u2019s absence the weight of British expectations in the gentlemen\u2019s singles will fall \nlargely on the shoulders of Draper. Physical issues had interrupted his progress until he \nmade his big breakthrough by winning the grass court title at Stuttgart last summer. In his \nnext tournament he beat Alcaraz at The Queen\u2019s Club and in March this year he joined the \nworld\u2019s top 10 by winning Indian Wells. Draper, nevertheless, will need to improve on his \nrecord at The Championships, where he has never gone beyond the second round.\nThe progress made by the likes of Draper, Mensik and Fils has been putting pressure on \n22-year-old Alcaraz and 23-year-old Jannik Sinner, who were the first players of their \ngeneration to win Grand Slam titles. In successfully defending his All England Club crown \nlast summer Alcaraz became only the second man in the Open era (after Federer) to win his \nfirst four Grand Slam singles finals. He also won his first four Grand Slam titles at a \nyounger age than Djokovic, Federer and Nadal, while Bjorn Borg and Boris Becker are the \nonly other men to have won multiple Wimbledon titles before the age of 22. The youngest \nman ever to win Roland-Garros and Wimbledon in the same year, Alcaraz is already \nthree-quarters of the way towards a \u2018career Grand Slam\u2019, with the Australian Open the only \nmajor jewel missing from his crown.\nAlcaraz and Sinner dominated men\u2019s tennis in 2024, with Sinner winning the two other \nGrand Slam tournaments, in Melbourne and New York. The Italian won his third Grand \nSlam title in 13 months when he made a successful defence of his Australian Open trophy \nthis January. He then missed three months after agreeing to serve a suspension following \ntwo failed drugs tests last year, although he was cleared of any deliberate intention to breach \nanti-doping rules. Although at his best on hard courts, Sinner won his first grass court title \nlast summer at Halle. He has also won plenty of matches at The Championships, having \nreached two quarter-finals and one semi-final in his last three appearances. Sinner beat \nAlcaraz in four sets in their only previous meeting at Wimbledon three summers ago.\nAlthough Murray\u2019s injury woes meant that he had never gone beyond the third round \nsince limping out of The Championships 2017, the Scot will be missed this summer, having \nbeen a focus of British interest ever since his Centre Court debut 20 years ago. Nevertheless, \nthe retirement of the 2013 and 2016 Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Champion has not meant his \ndeparture from the tennis scene as he made a surprise return for a six-month stint as \nDjokovic\u2019s coach at the start of this year. Djokovic went on to reach the Australian Open \nsemi-finals, beating Alcaraz along the way, before a leg injury ended his chances of claiming \nhis 25th Grand Slam title.\nDjokovic\u2019s Melbourne victory over Alcaraz was the eighth meeting between the two men \nin what has become a fascinating battle of the generations. Alcaraz, who has only just turned \n22, has beaten 38-year-old Djokovic in the last two Wimbledon finals. Indeed, Djokovic\u2019s \nonly two losses in his last 41 matches at The Championships were in those two finals. "}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Several broadcast partners \nreported record viewing figures last year and a number of new or extended media rights \nagreements will begin at these Championships.\n Players will enjoy an enhanced restaurant this year as part of the Millennium Building \nproject, which aims to improve their overall experience, while additional facilities for \nspectators will include a new public restaurant, The Cavendish, in the heart of No.1 Court. \nThe restaurant is named after Henry \u2018Cavendish\u2019 Jones, a committee member of what was \nthen the All England Croquet Club who in 1875 suggested setting aside an area where \ntennis and badminton could be played. \nOne hundred and fifty years on from that historic moment, this year\u2019s Championships \nwill mark some other significant milestones. It was exactly 100 years ago that a Qualifying \nCompetition for all five Championship events was held for the first time, at the \nRoehampton Club. This year also marks the 50th anniversary of one of the most remarkable \nfinals at The Championships, when Arthur Ashe became the first black player to win the \ngentlemen\u2019s singles title by beating Jimmy Connors, who had been the overwhelming \nfavourite. Who will be this year\u2019s headline-makers? We look forward to finding out.\nHaving broken into the world\u2019s top 10 in 2025, 23-year-old \nJack Draper (above) will be aiming to go past the second round  \nat The Championships for the first time"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

The meeting was \nchaired by the magazine\u2019s editor, John Henry Walsh, with the other \nattendees being Capt. Robert Fitzgerald Dalton, John Hinde Hale, the \nReverend Arthur Law, Walter Jones Whitmore (elected Hon. Secretary) \nand Samuel Horace Clarke Maddock, who was the new Hon. \nTreasurer. It was here, in the editor\u2019s room at the offices of Herbert \nCox, publisher of The Field, that the \u2018All England Croquet Club\u2019 \nwas founded. The new Committee agreed to meet again two \nweeks later. \n1869\nJuly saw the new Club organise its first croquet championship, held on a cricket ground \nat Crystal Palace and won by George Joad, with a second event played later in the year in \nEastbourne. On 24 September the decision was made to lease a four-acre site near what is \nnow the centre of Wimbledon, by the railway track \u2013 but was then a semi-rural London \noutpost, a long way from The Strand. The site was off Worple Road, in Nursery Lane, which \nis still there today, but now known as \u2018Nursery Road\u2019. The four-acre site was rectangular in \nshape, roughly 170 metres by 100 metres, and three-year rental went from \u00a350 in year one \nto \u00a375 in year two and \u00a3100 in year three \u2013 the equivalent of around \u00a36,000, \u00a38,500 and \n\u00a311,000 in today\u2019s money. An agreement was also made with London and South Western \nRailway to run a pathway from Wimbledon Station to the Grounds, for the princely sum \nof one pound (just over \u00a3100 today). One pound would have also bought you an annual \nsubscription to the Club, with a life subscription costing just over 10 pounds. The Earl of \nEssex was appointed the Club\u2019s first President.\n1870\nAs interest grew, a pavilion was erected and in May the ground was spread out into three \nseparate terraces, a decision which necessitated a gardener being hired. Fencing around the \nground was put up and a small pavilion, containing gentlemen\u2019s and ladies\u2019 rooms, plus a \nclub room, was built. In mid-Victorian England croquet was the main summer sport of the \nso-called \u2018leisure classes\u2019, and it could be enjoyed by young or old. \nIn June, the Croquet Championships were held on the Grounds for the first time, won \nby Walter Peel, as they would be in the following year as well. This was the first event in \nT\nhis section details just what happened on \u2013 and off \u2013 the lawns \nof both the sites over the last century and a half, as painstakingly \ncompiled by Alan Little in the Wimbledon Compendium over the \nlast 28 years. \nIt\u2019s not a definitive report, giving just a snapshot of what feels most \nsignificant and most memorable for any given Championships. Some \nextra research across the board has added rich information to the \nearly years, including some more weather (as if Wimbledon didn\u2019t have \nenough) and other details gleaned from a variety of reliable historical \nresources. Whilst continually looking to the future, The Championships\u2019 \nrich story has its roots in these real reports from the past, and with the \nmen, women (and animals) who made it all possible."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

There are few first-hand reports but it is said that founding member John H. Walsh \nfirst offered to exchange his pony roller for a life membership of the Club for his daughter. \nA Lady\u2019s or Gentleman\u2019s Membership was then valued at one guinea (about \u00a3100 today), \nwith the aforementioned Life Suscription costing 10 guineas. Further records of the era are \nnot known but records show that Walter Hayward Peel retained his croquet title.\n1872\nJohn H. Walsh, who had chaired the \ninaugural meeting in The Strand and who \nhad now become Club Secretary, generously \nfollowed up on the offer of his pony roller \nto The Club, with the actual pony being sold \non to them as well for the sum of \u00a323. A \nstory has circulated for years, which has no \nhistorical evidence, that the need to raise \nfunds for the repair of this pony roller \u2013 in order to maintain the croquet lawns \u2013 was the \nreason for staging the first Lawn Tennis Championships. A similar roller for the Nursery \nLane Grounds can still be seen on the Club\u2019s modern site, near the Museum building. \nA man known only as \u2018Mr. C. Black\u2019 won the fourth croquet title, with Mrs J.H. Walsh \ntaking the ladies\u2019 event. \n1873 \nIn a confident move, the lease on the Worple Road ground was renewed for a further 10 \nyears, at a cost of \u00a3100 a year. It was in December of this year that the first book of rules \nfor the game was spoken of, being compiled by a Welsh army officer called Major Walter \nClopton Wingfield. A party occurred in the December to which Wingfield later dedicated \nall of his rules booklets, promoted as The Major\u2019s Game of Lawn Tennis. A fan of many \nsporting endeavours, Major Wingfield was also an eccentric inventor, with a creative mind \nand boundless energy. He applied this entrepreneurial streak to sport, looking for ways to \nsupport his country estates and he was fascinated by this new racket sport, which could be \nplayed in the open air, away from the confines of an indoor arena. \nIn Club news, James Dunbar Heath won the croquet title. \n1874\nMajor Wingfield now applied for a patent for \u201ca new and improved portable court for \nplaying the ancient game of tennis\u201d, referring to the sport\u2019s storied past. He developed his \nrule book further, engaging with The Field magazine and its readers, creating a boxed set of \nthe equipment needed to play \u2013 with balls, \u2018tennis bats\u2019, poles, pegs, netting, a mallet, a brush \nand the \u2018BOOK OF THE GAME\u2019. This new phenomenon, now known simply as \u2018Lawn \nTennis\u2019, began to catch the world\u2019s attention. Originating from the French \u2018jeu de paume\u2019 \nand the rather exclusive \u2018Real Tennis\u2019, the game\u2019s development accelerated with the advent \nof the lawn mower in 1830, allowing for flatter lawns with shorter grass. Influences from \ngames such as \u2018Rackets\u2019 and the Basque \u2018Pelota\u2019 had already been seen, as clubs had already \nstarted to crop up in the UK, with these early adopters looking for a more rigorous exercise \nthan provided by genteel croquet. \nBack in Wimbledon James Dunbar Heath retained his croquet title.

Reginald Gray, from Bermuda but studying in London, \nwas thought to be one of four men said to have played the very first game of lawn tennis on \nthe ground early that summer. The court could also be used for badminton, the racket sport \nusing shuttlecocks instead of balls, and the British game of \u2018battledore and shuttlecock\u2019. \nMarylebone Cricket Club, nine miles up the road had, on 29 May, issued its first set of \u2018unified\u2019 \nrules for this game of lawn tennis, as there were previously numerous versions being played. \nThe Club chose to adapt these (an hourglass court, the use of real tennis scoring and only the \nserver being able to win points) for the games being played on its lawns. \nEarly tennis adopter Reginald Gray went on to win the All England croquet title later in \nthe summer season.\n1876\nThis new tennis phenomenon was really catching on now, with four new courts, or a whole \nterrace, being created, replacing croquet lawns. By the 29 June the Club saw the need \nto have a Committee member elected who would have exclusive responsibility for lawn \ntennis, and George Nicol was the man chosen for that role. Nicol was previously known \nas a croquet player, and was, in 1869, one of four men to all be considered an All England \nCroquet Champion, in the organisationally fragmented sport.\nColonel Busk won the croquet title.\n1877\nA momentous year in Wimbledon\u2019s history for two main reasons. Firstly, on 14 April the \nClub extended its name to become \u2018The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club\u2019. \nSecondly, this name change was to be celebrated by the staging of its first lawn tennis \nChampionships, beginning on Monday 9 July. There would only be a gentlemen\u2019s singles \nevent, with a field of 22, who each paid one guinea to enter, and a final to be played on 19 \nJuly. This 22-entry draw led to the strange situation of having three, rather than four, semi-\nfinalists. There was a pre-agreed break in play on 13 and 14 July, due to the annual Eton v \nHarrow cricket match, played at Lord\u2019s. \nUsing a now rectangular court and real tennis scoring methods the battles commenced \non the 12 dedicated courts. The equipment for this first tournament was supplied by Jefferies \nand Co. of Woolwich, providing posts, nets and balls. The first final was won by Wimbledon \nlocal, Spencer Gore, beating William Marshall and walking away with a not unreasonable \nsum of 12 guineas, or \u00a31,200 today. They were watched on a damp afternoon by around 200 \nspectators. On top of the financial reward, Gore received the highly valuable \u2018Field Cup\u2019, \npresented by The Field magazine. \nResearch through the Met Office shows us that the London weather between 9 and 19 \nJuly was generally mild and dry to begin with, followed by rain and wind in the middle and \nlater period, with a final played on damp, slippery courts.\n1878\nWimbledon became a year-long commitment, as levelling work completed during the \nwinter left the courts in rude health come the summer.

A whopping 700 \npeople watched Frank Hadow steal victory from local man, and reigning champion, Spencer \nGore in the aforementioned Challenge Round, the effective \u2018final\u2019. \nWarm and dry weather was enjoyed throughout London for the whole tournament from \n15 to 20 July. \n1879\nWith all the change in recent history, 1879 was a reasonably uneventful third year in \nNursery Lane, although crowds swelled and the event continued to grow in popularity, \nboasting 45 players in the main field. One notable change saw balls and court equipment \nbeing supplied by the company \u2018Ayres\u2019 for the first time. Ayres were a renowned sporting \ngoods firm, dating back to 1810, having built their reputation in the world of archery. \nSpectators were also able to shelter from the weather under thatched summer houses, with \nopen sides, which had originally been erected for the croquet players.\nOver a thousand people watched the All Comers Final between John Hartley and the \nwonderfully named Vere St. Leger Goold. Goold was a colourful character to say the least, \nwho took his own life on Devil\u2019s Island \u2013 the penal colony of Cayenne \u2013 as he served a life \nsentence for murder. Victorious Hartley went on to take the main trophy without playing \na Challenge Round as the holder, Frank Hadow, had decided not to defend his title. The \nCommittee rejected the suggestion to stage a Ladies\u2019 Singles Championship.\nThe tournament period from 7 to 16 July was generally cool in London with intermittent \nrain throughout. \n1880\nHaving commenced with the supply of balls and equipment in the previous year, Ayres \nnow provided two movable stands, constructed and erected to the side of a \u2018centre court\u2019, in \nthe middle of the ground. They also provided the first scoring boards and had their name \nemblazoned all over these constructions, in a promotional way that would never be seen \nagain in Wimbledon\u2019s history. Crowds continued to grow, as 1,300 packed in to watch the \nChallenge Round, in which John Hartley retained his trophy, to gather up his final major \ntitle. The powers-that-were fiddled a little more with the actual rules of lawn tennis, most \nnotably with the introduction of the \u2018let\u2019 service, when the ball clipped the net before \nlanding in. \nThe tournament period from 15 to 20 July was cool with generally light but regular rain \nacross London. \n1881\nThe growth continued, with further temporary stands erected around the previous year\u2019s \nidea of a principal \u2018centre court\u2019, now covering three sides of the playing area in the middle \nof the Grounds. These were logically named \u2018Stands A, B and C\u2019. The hefty constructions \nwere in place for the tournament from 2 to 13 July and were then stored down the road in \nsheds for the winter. With popularity soaring, the Club decided to purchase the freehold of \nthe ground, for a not insubstantial amount of \u00a33,000 \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a3300,000 in today\u2019s \nmarket \u2013 to be paid in instalments over the coming years.

Renshaw, along with his brother, \nErnest, would be seen as instrumental in the coming years for transforming tennis from a \npastime to a popular competitive, and spectator, sport. They were a charismatic pair, with \nengaging personalities and a truly original lawn tennis style.\nIt was also a significant year for lawn tennis as it marked the first staging of the US \nNational Championship (the future US Open) event, which would soon make up one \nquarter of the tennis majors, or all together, the \u2018Grand Slam\u2019 (alongside Roland-Garros, \nthe Australian Open and The Championships at Wimbledon). The first event was held on \ngrass courts in Newport, Rhode Island (moving to New York in 1915) and the gentlemen\u2019s \nsingles was won by Richard Sears. \nHot weather was enjoyed in London at the start of tournament, which was held from  \n2 to 13 July, before some light rain and cooler temperatures towards the end.\n1882\nA tipping point was reached when the Club decided to drop the word \u2018Croquet\u2019 from its \ntitle, such was the increasing popularity of this phenomenon known as \u2018lawn tennis\u2019, with \nthe former no longer being played on the Grounds after this season. \u2018The All England \nLawn Tennis Club\u2019 continued its upward surge, with over 2,000 attending the Challenge \nRound. They were not disappointed as William Renshaw defeated his twin brother, Ernest, \nin a nail-biting five-set final. \nRecords show that London experienced cool weather throughout the tournament, from \n8 to 17 July, with regular showers and some strong winds towards the end of the period. \n1883\nWith professionalism the order of the day, the Club purchased a new heavy roller and, no \ndoubt as a result, a new horse to do the hard graft. The investments were paying off with \nanother 25 per cent jump in attendances as a crowd of 2,500 watched the final, once again \nplayed out between the Renshaw twins, once again running to five sets and once again \nbeing won by William, for his third on the trot. This would turn out to be the last year that \nonly temporary stands would be used. \nLondon experienced cool temperatures between 7 and 17 July, with rain over the \nweekend seeing the final, Challenge Round, delayed.\n1884\nA momentous year for the Club with the launch of a Ladies\u2019 Singles Championships, \nto be played after the conclusion of the Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship. There was \na field of 13 with young Maud Watson coming from a set down to beat her big sister, \nLilian, in the final. She walked away with a silver flower basket as first prize, which she had \nchosen as there was no ladies\u2019 trophy for the first two years it was staged. The creation of \nthis event established tennis as a liberating sport for women. It was not the only exciting \nnew discipline to be introduced, being joined by a gentlemen\u2019s doubles, or \u2018four-handed\u2019, \ncompetition in which 10 pairs contested. Talented twins William and Ernest Renshaw \ncame out on top, receiving a cup donated by Oxford University. \nYou hadn\u2019t previously needed to be British to enter the tournament, but it had certainly \nhelped, as no other nationalities had previously bothered competing. That all changed in \n1884 with three competitors in the gentlemen\u2019s singles taking the boat across the Atlantic \n\u2013 James Dwight, Arthur Rives and reigning US Open champion Richard \u2018Dick\u2019 Sears. They \nno doubt enjoyed the experience but couldn\u2019t prevent home favourite William Renshaw \nwalking away with the trophy\u2026 again.

This created a \nkind of festival of lawn tennis, in the way we enjoy in the modern era. \nThe ladies\u2019 singles celebrated this promotion to the main stage by providing the \ntournament\u2019s most intriguing story as Great Britain\u2019s Charlotte \u2018Lottie\u2019 Dod became the \nyoungest-ever winner, at the incredibly tender age of 15 years and 285 days. The sporting all-\nrounder from Cheshire also excelled at golf, hockey and archery, in which she won a silver \nmedal at the 1908 Olympics.

These were both now in the \npermanent possession of William Renshaw after he won each three times in succession. The \ndecision was taken that the new trophy would never become the property of the winner. \nThe inscription on the front of the Cup read, \u201cThe All England Lawn Tennis Club Single \nHanded Championship of the World\u201d.\nThe weather remained very warm throughout, interspersed with cooler, breezier spells.\n1888\nThis year saw the advent of a Wimbledon tradition which would become synonymous \nwith the tournament across the world: bad weather seriously interrupting, or even totally \nstopping, play.

Shrubs and flower beds were added, the \npavilion was redecorated and the stands were repainted, creating an altogether more pleasing \ntournament experience. After the previous year\u2019s less than clement weather, the drainage \nsystem of the lawns was also greatly improved.\nOn court, normal service was resumed as William Renshaw took the gentlemen\u2019s singles \ntitle home for a seventh time, at the expense of his brother again, a record that would \nbe equalled by Pete Sampras in 2000 and beaten by Roger Federer in 2017. Renshaw\u2019s \nunprecedented success sparked a massive rise in interest in the sport and he came to be \nknown as the \u2018founding father of tennis\u2019.

Construction work had been going on all over the Grounds, with Centre \nCourt having both a new stand and, for the first time, a clock on display. Another sizable \naesthetic change saw the Club adopt its now ubiquitous colour scheme of green and purple \nfor the first time. Whilst the exact reason for the choice is not known for sure, these original \ncolours \u2013 blue, yellow, red and green \u2013 were almost identical to those of the Royal Marines \ncolours, necessitating a change. The romantics liked to believe that the choice was inspired \nby \u201cWimbledon\u2019s green and impurpled Hills\u201d, a phrase used in a poem by William Blake, \nwho was known to reference south London and Surrey regularly in his work. \nAnother phrase destined to be associated with The Championships forever, \u2018Order of Play\u2019, \nwas first seen on the back of the programme, now available for sale in the Grounds. Not to \nbe outdone by the ladies of the previous year, 1909 also featured the oldest player to win the \nsingles title, when Arthur \u2018Baby\u2019 \u2013 the nickname was becoming ridiculous \u2013 Gore, won the \nlast of his three titles at the tender age of 41 years and 182 days. He is still the oldest player to \nachieve the feat. Britain\u2019s Dora Boothby won her one and only ladies\u2019 singles title. \n1910\nThe improvements to the Grounds continued swiftly with an extensive plan to pave and \nconcrete all the pathways. The year would also mark the first (and most certainly not the \nlast) time that the Gentlemen\u2019s All Comer\u2019s Singles would be contested by two overseas \nplayers, New Zealand\u2019s Anthony Wilding defeating America\u2019s Beals Wright before edging \nGreat Britain\u2019s Arthur Gore in the Challenge Round.

The sight of this triangular construction raising up on its \nwinch would become synonymous with Wimbledon over the rainy days in years to come. \nA Championships memorable for the excellent weather enjoyed during the entire \nsecond week was also competitively red hot on the courts, as over 100 players entered the \ngentlemen\u2019s singles \u2013 a new record. The event was won again by the popular New Zealander \nAnthony Wilding. The future world No.1 would prove to be his country\u2019s only winner of a \nMajor title at the time of writing.

Having comfortably won the ladies\u2019 singles, Lenglen \nmatched this achievement in the doubles, the third year in succession that she would win \nboth titles. The gentlemen\u2019s event was won again by Bill Tilden.\nAs well as being the last year at the old location, the move also marked the last year of \nthe Challenge Round system, in which the reigning champion would only play one match, \nagainst the winner of the All Comers\u2019 Event in the deciding match.

He lost in \nthe second round to Andre Gobert of France.\nOn 9 September, around 1.5 miles due north, building work commenced on the new \nGrounds in Wimbledon Park Road. The Centre Court was built with reinforced concrete, \nusing 3,000 tons of shingle, 1,700 tons of sand and 600 tons of cement. The seating alone \naccounted for over 21 miles of wooden slats. A disc of paper, just 20mm in diameter, was \nplaced on the turf to check that it could be viewed from every seat, guaranteeing exceptional \nviews for all. The position of the court and the roof also ensured that no shadow would \nappear until 7pm. There would be 12 additional courts, an enormous tea lawn and parking \nfacilities for 400 cars. In the words of Club Secretary, George Hillyard: \u201cLet us look to it \nthat we construct and equip our ground that it will immediately be recognised as the finest, \nnot only in England, but the world.\u201d\n1922\nThe new 13-acre ground at Wimbledon Park Road was opened at a cost of \u00a3140,000, \nclose to \u00a38 million in today\u2019s market. Capt. Stanley Peach designed the brand-new Centre \nCourt (which retained its name even if it no longer occupied a central position within the \nGrounds), housing an impressive 9,989 seated and 3,600 standing up, which was scheduled \nto open on the first day, 26 June, at 2.45pm, in the presence of King George V and Queen \nMary. Quite fittingly there was a short rain delay before, at 3.30pm, the King appeared in \nthe Royal Box, gave three blows on a gong and declared the new Grounds open. \nAfter the tarpaulin was removed, at 3.45pm Great Britain\u2019s Leslie Godfree served the \nfirst ball to his compatriot, Algernon Kingscote, who netted the return. Godfree dashed \nforward to pocket the ball as a memento of the historic occasion.

It was every bit as complicated as it sounded.

Helen Wills was \nnow Helen Moody, but the result was the same as she won the ladies\u2019 singles,for a fourth \nyear on the trot.\nBill Tilden won the third of his three titles, 10 years after his first, at the tender age  \nof 37. It would be his last Major victory before joining the newly formed professional tour. \nExcellent weather was enjoyed throughout.\n1931\nMore improvements were seen as the wrought iron Doherty Memorial gates, celebrating the \nfamous brothers, were erected at the south-east entrance of the Grounds. Elsewhere, the  Ball \nBoys were given a rest room, near to the Referee\u2019s office, which must have been a  blessed relief.\nOn court it was a remarkable year, as there was no Gentlemen\u2019s Singles final.

The ground capacity was fixed at 28,000 and once this \nnumber was reached the only means of entry to the Grounds was by the purchase of tickets \nhanded in for re-sale by spectators leaving for the day. Consequently, the attendance figure \nfor the Fortnight was greatly reduced to 347,979. Smoking was prohibited in the covered \nstands of the Centre Court and No.1 Court for the first time.

Faced with the prospect of further bad weather the \ndecision was taken on the Friday evening to play for the first time ever on the first Sunday. \nThis \u2018Middle Sunday\u2019 became a unique day in Wimbledon\u2019s history.

By the start of play at 12 \nnoon the Centre Court was jam-packed with excited spectators, creating a carnival atmosphere \nwith repeated Mexican waves bringing roars from the crowd. A special programme was on sale \nand past champions were invited to the Royal Box.\nReplica gentlemen\u2019s singles and ladies\u2019 singles trophies were provided to the winners for \nthe first time. In the gentlemen\u2019s case this was taken home by the German, Michael Stich, \nwho beat his countryman Boris Becker, who was appearing in his sixth final in seven years. \nThe ladies\u2019 title went once again to Steffi Graf, winning for a third time.\nFor this one year, the (generally dreadful) weather \u2013 which did improve in the second \nweek \u2013 itself formed the key part of the narrative above.\n1992\nAmongst much pre-event building work, and aesthetic improvements all over, the Centre \nCourt roof was completely replaced by a new structure supported by four pillars instead \nof 26.

Before start of play on the Centre Court the crowd were entertained by a \ntraditional jazz band.\nIn a groundbreaking development, a special radio station known as \u2018Radio Wimbledon\u2019 \nprovided visitors and the local community with up to 14 hours of live programming each \nday during The Championships.

A ladies\u2019 military band \nplayed on the Centre Court on the last two days.\nThe Club announced its \u2018Long Term Plan\u2019 to enhance and protect the pre-eminence \nof The Championships, as its associated Ground Company purchased the freehold of the \nneighbouring Wimbledon Park Golf Course. Major internal refurbishment of the Grounds \nhad taken place over the preceding year and around the courts there was much tighter \nsecurity, following the shocking stabbing of Monica Seles at Hamburg earlier in the year. \nAs in the previous year, efforts were made to create a festive atmosphere on the first \nSaturday, as 2,000 Centre Court seats were sold on the day at a reduced price. At 2pm a \nnumber of the Royal Box guests were introduced to the public, including the 1933\u20131936 \nBritish Davis Cup team, the Chairman\u2019s special guests (all ladies) and other sporting \npersonalities. This would become a popular annual tradition on the middle Saturday. \nOn court the American Pete Sampras won his first title, whilst Steffi Graf won her \nfifth, as she beat Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic. The match was memorable for \nNovotna\u2019s collapse from the brink of victory, after leading by a double break of serve in \nthe third set and seemingly in complete control. Graf stormed back to win and Novotna \ncried uncontrollably on the sympathetic Duchess of Kent\u2019s shoulder during the trophy \npresentation, in what has become one of Wimbledon\u2019s most enduring images. \nA warm and sunny meeting, during which there were no interruptions for rain, attracted \na near-record crowd.

The chanting was continuous, akin to a football or rugby match, and \nlikely unparalleled in the history of The Championships.\nFive sets later Goran Ivanisevic became the first Croatian, the first wild card and only \nthe second unseeded player to win the Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship. It marked the \nculmination of a lifelong dream, after he had been defeated in three previous finals.

The total attendance for the normal 13 days was 469,305, the lowest since 2007. \nPoor weather in the first week once again necessitated a \u2018Middle Sunday\u2019, with the ticketing \nbeing managed entirely online for the first time. 22,000 tickets were available online via the \nTicketmaster website, which were sold out in 27 minutes, as some 111,000 people applied. \nNew uniforms designed by Ralph Lauren were introduced for the Chair and Line \nUmpires as well as the Ball Boys and Girls. The Wheelchair Doubles events introduced in \nrecent years were now matched by Ladies\u2019 and Gentlemen\u2019s Singles disciplines. \nThe Davis Cup trophy was on view to the public during the Championships, after the \nBritish team had triumphed against Belgium the previous December.\nSerena Williams retained her Ladies\u2019 Singles Championship, bringing her tally up to \nseven, and giving her a total of 22 Major titles, tying her with Steffi Graf in the Open era. \nAndy Murray won the Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship for the second time, defeating \nCanada\u2019s Milos Raonic in the final. For the first time, two French pairs, Pierre-Hugues \nHerbert and Nicolas Mahut and Julien Benneteau and Edouard Roger-Vasselin contested \nthe gentlemen\u2019s doubles final, with the former winning the title. The ladies\u2019 doubles was won \nby Serena and Venus Williams for the sixth time.\nImmediately after The Championships the northern part of Aorangi Park was made a \nrestricted area and work started in earnest to provide a retractable roof for No.1 Court, to \nbring it in line with the Centre Court. \nIntermittent rain on several days of the first week caused a backlog of matches and led to \nplay on \u2018Middle Sunday\u2019. Conditions were mainly dry and warm, with occasional showers, \nduring the second week.\n2017\nFor the first time since 1896 The Championships did not commence until July. This \nwas made possible two years earlier when the gap between Roland-Garros and The \nChampionships was extended from two to three weeks.\nIn other changes, the Qualifying event, staged in Roehampton, became ticketed, with all \nfunds raised donated to the Wimbledon Foundation. On site, the retractable roof project \ntook shape on No.1 Court, as the previous fixed roof was removed. \nThe association between the Club and the BBC was commemorated by the celebration of \nthree anniversaries \u2013 90 years of radio coverage, 80 years of television coverage and 50 years \nof colour television coverage. \nIt was a momentous year on court as Switzerland\u2019s resurgent Roger Federer captured \nthe Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship for the eighth time, surpassing the total held by \nWilliam Renshaw and Pete Sampras. He also became the first man since 1976 to win the \ntitle without dropping a set. Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza of Spain, the runner-up of 2015, became \nthe new Ladies\u2019 Singles Champion after defeating Venus Williams, back in the final after an \nabsence of eight years.\nLukasz Kubot of Poland and Marcelo Melo of Brazil became the first men from their \nrespective countries to win a Wimbledon title after they triumphed in an epic men\u2019s doubles \nfinal against Oliver Marach (Austria) and Mate Pavic (Croatia), lasting almost five hours. \nThis meant that the ladies\u2019 doubles final didn\u2019t begin until 9:28pm. Somewhat incredibly, it \nwas finished by 10.24pm, as Ekatarina Makarova and Elena Vesnina of Russia beat Hao-\nChing Chan of Taipei and Monica Niculescu of Romania 6-0, 6-0. Great Britain\u2019s Jamie \nMurray repeated his feat of 10 years earlier of winning the mixed doubles, on this occasion \nwith Martina Hingis.\n2017 marked the first year that H.R.H.

Celebrating the Club\u2019s origins as a croquet club, the \nWimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum held a special exhibition looking at croquet\u2019s evolution \nthrough the ages. The year also marked 50 years of Open tennis and 125 years of the Ladies\u2019 \nSingles Championship. \nThe development of No.1 Court continued throughout the previous year, with a new \nfixed roof in place, in preparation for the final stage \u2013 the retractable section \u2013 due for \ncompletion before The Championships 2019. Prize money continued to rise substantially, \nwith the total for all events amounting to \u00a334 million and the winners of the Gentlemen\u2019s \nand Ladies\u2019 Singles Championships each receiving \u00a32.25 million.\nIn technological advancements a first match was broadcast live via the AEL TC\u2019s global \nbroadcast partners and on wimbledon.com. Spectators in the Queue were able to pay for their \ntickets using contactless and other card payments for the first time and free public wi-fi was \nextended into the Queue and throughout the Grounds. \nOn court the main story was in the ladies\u2019 singles as Serena Williams reached the final 10 \nmonths after giving birth to her first baby. Ranked down at No.181 in the world the seven-\ntime Ladies\u2019 Singles Champion was seeded No.25 but lost to Angelique Kerber of Germany. \nThe story of the gentlemen\u2019s singles revolved around the extraordinary length of matches. \nIn the first (and longest-ever) semi-final Kevin Anderson took six hours and 36 minutes to \nsubdue 2010\u2019s marathon man John Isner, the final set finishing 26-24. Novak Djokovic and \nRafael Nadal followed them on court, proceeding to play the second-longest semi-final in \nWimbledon history, taking five hours and\u00a015 minutes. Djokovic eventually won the match, \nwhich extended into Saturday and was played under the roof, before returning the next day \nto defeat an exhausted Anderson and claim his fourth title.\n2019\nAfter a very wet early summer, nobody would have predicted that \n2019 would produce one of the driest Championships on record. \nNot a single minute of play was lost to rain during the Fortnight. \nNevertheless, the new No.1 Court retractable roof was called into \naction on four occasions to allow matches to be completed after dark. \nThe roof had been officially tested in front of a capacity crowd at the \nNo.1 Court Celebration event in May. No.1 Court was also the \nsubject of Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum\u2019s special exhibition \nfor 2019-2020.\nGround capacity was increased to 42,000 and the aggregate \nattendance for The Championships (500,397) totalled over half a million for just the second \ntime in history. \nTotal prize money for The Championships increased to \u00a338 million, an 11.8 per cent \nincrease on 2018. The ladies\u2019 and gentlemen\u2019s singles champions each received \u00a32.35 million. \nQuad Wheelchair Singles and Doubles events were introduced to the programme for \nthe first time, Dylan Alcott of Australia winning the singles and teaming up with Great \nBritain\u2019s Andy Lapthorne to win the doubles. \nFollowing the previous year\u2019s interminable semi-final between Kevin Anderson and John \nIsner, tie-breaks were introduced to decide any match reaching 12-12 in the final set. The \nnew rule was implemented on three occasions, including only once in singles.

After Federer failed to convert two championship points on his own serve earlier \nin the set, it was Djokovic who prevailed in the deciding tie-break and won the title for \nthe fifth time. He received the Challenge Cup from HRH The Duchess of Cambridge, the \nAEL TC\u2019s Patron, who was presenting the trophy for the first time. \nDespite his failure to clinch a ninth title, Federer did achieve two notable landmarks \nduring The Championships. He became the first man to win more than 100 singles matches \nand he also surpassed Goran Ivanisevic\u2019s record for most career aces at Wimbledon.\nThe gentlemen\u2019s singles final was the longest in Wimbledon history, lasting four hours \nand 57 minutes. By an amazing coincidence, the previous day\u2019s gentlemen\u2019s doubles final \nhad lasted exactly the same length of time. Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah became \nthe first Colombians to win a Wimbledon title when they beat Nicolas Mahut and Edouard \nRoger-Vasselin in five sets, the first four of which went to tie-breaks.\nIn the ladies\u2019 singles final, Simona Halep of Romania played an almost flawless match, \nmaking only three unforced errors in a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Serena Williams. Halep\u2019s \nperformance was statistically the \u2018cleanest\u2019 final in recorded history and left Williams still \ntantalisingly short of a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title.\nEarlier in the year, The All England Lawn Tennis Ground plc announced the issue \nof 2520 Centre Court debentures for The Championships 2021-2025. The issue was \nfully subscribed and raised \u00a3162.3 million (net of the nominal value, VAT and estimated \nexpenses). The proceeds will be used for AEL TG\u2019s capital investment in the continuing \ndevelopment and improvement of the Grounds, including the No.1 Court Project, the wider \nAEL TC Master Plan and the acquisition of The Wimbledon Park Golf Club.\nIn December, Philip Brook retired after nine years as Club Chairman and was succeeded \nby Ian Hewitt. One of Hewitt\u2019s first acts was to appoint Sally Bolton as the AEL TC\u2019s first \nfemale Chief Executive. Following a period of handover, Bolton took over from Richard \nLewis on 1 August.\n2020\nFor all the wrong reasons, 2020 was one of the most extraordinary years in Wimbledon \nhistory. With the world in the grip of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic and the UK in \nlockdown, it was announced on 1 April that the 134th Championships was cancelled. \nOptions for playing The Championships behind closed doors, or later in the year, had \nbeen considered. However, in the end, cancellation, while regrettable, was the only realistic \ndecision. Fortunately, the AEL TC had had the foresight, as long ago as 2003, to add \npandemic cover to its insurance policy, meaning that the AEL TC\u2019s financial position \nremained secure despite the cancellation. Since the first Championships in 1877, the only \nother times The Championships had not taken place were during the two world wars \n(1915-1918 and 1940-1945).\nIn the absence of The Championships, the AEL TC turned its attention to contributing \nto the emergency response to the Covid-19 crisis. The AEL TC kitchen delivered 200 \ndaily hot meals for three months for those in need in Merton and Wandsworth, and much \nof the 2020 strawberry supply was donated to local hospitals. In addition, the 2020 balls \nwere donated to clubs, parks and schools across the UK and 2020 towels were donated \nto charities supporting the homeless, including Crisis. The Wimbledon Foundation also \ncreated a \u00a31.2m Coronavirus Fund (later increased to \u00a31.5m) to be distributed among \nlocal and national charities.\nThanks to the insurance cover, it was possible to pay \u00a310m in lieu of prize money \nto the 620 players whose world ranking would have enabled them to gain entry to The \nChampionships 2020 by direct acceptance into the Main Draw or Qualifying event. \nPayments were also made to many of the officials who would have worked at The \nChampionships 2020."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Due to the \nongoing Covid-19 pandemic, crowds were initially limited to 50 per cent of normal capacity. \nHowever, with the tournament being designated part of the UK government\u2019s Event \nResearch Programme, limits were increased over the Fortnight, culminating in full houses \non Centre Court to witness the two singles finals.\nTo ensure the safety of players and spectators, a \u2018Minimised Risk Environment\u2019 was in \noperation during The Championships. Players and their entourages, including those who \nlived locally, were required to stay in official hotels and were not allowed to mix with the \ngeneral public. \nNo Public Ballot for tickets was held, \u2018with those who had paid for tickets for the \ncancelled Championships 2020 having their allocations carried over to 2022. Instead, \nall tickets were sold online in the weeks leading up to The Championships. Neither \nthe traditional Queue nor Ticket Resale were in operation. Also absent from The \nChampionships 2021 were the Invitation Doubles events.\nThroughout the Fortnight, Royal Box invitations and Centre Court tickets were \ndistributed to individuals and organisations who had contributed significantly in the \nresponse to the pandemic as a \u2018thank you\u2019, with The Hill also featuring a \u2018thank you\u2019 message \nthroughout the Fortnight.\nFor the first time, the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum was open for free to ticket \nholders during The Championships. Visitors were able to enjoy the new temporary \nexhibition celebrating the upcoming centenary: \u2018Centre Court: 100 Years of Change\u2019. \nNovak Djokovic won his sixth gentlemen\u2019s singles title, joining Roger Federer and Rafael \nNadal on 20 Grand Slam titles in the process. Ashleigh Barty was a popular winner of \nthe ladies\u2019 singles, becoming the first Australian to take the title since Evonne Goolagong \nCawley in 1980.\nThe ladies\u2019 doubles was won by Hsieh Su-Wei and Elise Mertens. It was Hsieh\u2019s third \nvictory in the event, each with a different partner. The gentlemen\u2019s doubles was won by the \nCroatian pairing of Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic.\nThe mixed doubles final featured three British players, with Neal Skupski and his \nAmerican partner, Desirae Krawczyk, defeating Joe Salisbury and Harriet Dart.\nFollowing The Championships, HRH The Duke of Kent stood down as President of the \nAEL TC, a position he had held since 1969.Later in the year, a new No.1 Court debenture \nissue, covering the period 2022 to 2026, raised \u00a346.875 million.\n \n2022\nFor the first time since 2019, The Championships took place without the need for \nsignificant Covid-19 restrictions.

As a \nresult, the ATP and WTA withheld world ranking points from The Championships.\nThe format and scheduling of The Championships saw significant changes. For the first \ntime, play was scheduled on Middle Sunday, meaning that the fourth round was played over \ntwo days instead of one. The second Tuesday and Wednesday saw an even split of gentlemen\u2019s \nand ladies\u2019 quarter-finals, and the mixed doubles final was brought forward to the Thursday.\nOther changes included the introduction of a 14-and-under event to complement \nthe Junior Championships and the doubling in size of the Quad Wheelchair draws. The \nInvitation events, being played for the first time since 2019, also saw a change, with the \nGentlemen\u2019s Senior Invitation Doubles being replaced by a Mixed Invitation Doubles event.\nIn a move to standardise the scoring system across the Grand Slams, the final set tie-\nbreak rule was amended so that a first-to-10 tie-break would take place at six games all. \nOther innovations saw new Umpires\u2019 chairs on Centre and No.1 Courts, new Umpires\u2019 and \nBall Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 uniforms and a new central entrance for players onto Centre Court.\n2022 saw the All England Club celebrate the centenary of its move from Worple Road \nto the new Church Road Grounds. To mark the occasion, a special ceremony took place on \nCentre Court before the start of play on Middle Sunday. Sue Barker and John McEnroe \nintroduced a parade of 26 former singles champions. Also honoured was Barker, who was \nretiring after 30 years of presenting the BBC\u2019s TV coverage of The Championships.\nOn the court, Novak Djokovic won his fourth consecutive gentlemen\u2019s singles title, his \nseventh in total, bringing him level with Pete Sampras and William Renshaw and just one short \nof Roger Federer\u2019s record. Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan won the ladies\u2019 singles, becoming the \nfirst player from her country to win a Grand Slam singles title. Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina \nSiniakova won the ladies\u2019 doubles for the second time, four years after their first victory, and \nNeal Skupski and Desirae Krawczyk retained the mixed doubles title they had won in 2021. \nThe gentlemen\u2019s doubles was won by the Australian pair Matthew Ebden and Max Purcell.\nIn December 2022, AEL TC Chairman Ian Hewitt indicated his intention to retire \nfollowing The Championships 2023.\n2023\nThe return to normality following the Covid-19 pandemic continued with the \nreintroduction of the Wimbledon Public Ballot, which had not taken place since 2019. \nAlso returning to The Championships were players from Russia and Belarus, who had been \nexcluded the previous year due to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In order to compete, players \nfrom these two countries were required to sign personal declarations agreeing to play as \nneutral athletes, not make public expressions of support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine or \naccept state funding in relation to their participation in The Championships.\nAn amendment was made to the \u2018almost entirely white\u2019 clothing rule, allowing female \nplayers to wear mid- or dark-coloured undershorts if they chose, relieving a potential \nsource of anxiety around menstrual cycles. In other innovations, The Championships \njoined the other Grand Slam tournaments in a one-year experiment to allow off-court \ncoaching, while as part of the All England Club\u2019s commitment to become \u2018environment \npositive\u2019 by 2030, a number of initiatives were introduced for 2023. One of the most \nnoticeable changes saw players provided with evian refillable water bottles on court, \nreplacing the existing plastic bottles.\nMedia interview facilities moved from their former home in the Millennium Building to \na purpose-built space on top of the Broadcast Centre called the Media Pavilion. The Media \nPavilion features a new Media Theatre, containing state-of-the-art technology, and a further \nseven interview rooms, an outdoor broadcast mixed zone, and stand-up and presentation \npositions for rights-holders."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Alcaraz defeated defending champion Novak Djokovic in a thrilling five-set \nfinal that lasted four hours and 42 minutes, the third-longest in Wimbledon history. It was \nDjokovic\u2019s first defeat at The Championships since 2017 and his first on Centre Court since \nhe lost to Andy Murray in the 2013 final.

As a result, \nKichenok became the first Ukrainian to win a Wimbledon title.\nDespite regular interruptions for rain throughout the Fortnight, improved conditions on \nthe final weekend ensured that the Championships schedule was completed on time. Over the \ncourse of the 14 days, a record aggregate crowd of 532,651 attended The Championships 2023.\nIn August, Ian Hewitt stood down as Chairman of the AEL TC and was replaced \nby Deborah Jevans CBE, who became the Club\u2019s first female Chair. Also retiring was \nChampionships Referee Gerry Armstrong, to be replaced by Denise Parnell \u2013 an Assistant \nReferee since 2006 \u2013 who became The Championships\u2019 first female Referee.\n \n2024\nFor the second consecutive year the Fortnight was badly affected by the weather, creating a \nchallenging first Championships for new Referee Denise Parnell. However, despite being 80 \nmatches behind schedule after prolonged rain on the second Tuesday, conditions improved \nenough for the programme to be completed on time.

Djokovic had come into The Championships \nwith serious doubts over his fitness, having had surgery on a knee injury just a few weeks \npreviously. Alcaraz was presented with the trophy by HRH The Princess of Wales, who was \nmaking just her second public appearance of the year since revealing that she was receiving \ntreatment for cancer.

Thirty-seven went to five sets, a \nrecord for any Grand Slam tournament. In 11 of these matches, a player fought back from \ntwo sets down to win. And, for the first time in the Open era in any Grand Slam event, \nthere were no 6-0 sets.\nOn the ladies\u2019 side, Barbora Krejcikova became the eighth different Ladies\u2019 Singles \nChampion in eight years and the second in a row from the Czech Republic. In the final, she \ndefeated Jasmine Paolini, the first Italian to reach the final. In winning the title, Krejcikova \nplayed a total of 175 games, the most any player has ever played in the event.

It was a first mixed doubles title at The Championships for Hsieh, \nwho had previously won the ladies\u2019 doubles four times. Due to the adverse weather, a first-\nto-10-points tie-break replaced the third set in every round of the mixed doubles.\nThe draws for the Wheelchair Singles and Doubles events were doubled in size to 16 \nplayers and eight pairs respectively. Diede de Groot won the Ladies\u2019 Wheelchair Singles \nfor the sixth time. It was her 15th consecutive Grand Slam title. In the Gentlemen\u2019s \nWheelchair Singles, there was joy and relief for Great Britain\u2019s Alfie Hewett, the defeated \nfinalist for the previous two years, who completed the career Grand Slam.\nThere were also emotional scenes on the first Thursday, when Wimbledon said goodbye \nto two-time Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Champion Andy Murray. Although not fit enough \nto compete in the singles, Murray made his final appearance at The Championships \nalongside his brother, Jamie, in the doubles. After they lost their first round match to \nRinky Hijikata and John Peers, a ceremony took place on Centre Court in which a video \nmontage of his career highlights was shown and he was interviewed on court by Sue \nBarker. Murray had been due to also compete in the mixed doubles alongside Emma \nRaducanu, but Raducanu withdrew before their first round match.\nAlso taking place on the first Thursday, 4 July, was the UK general election.

Since then, an unseeded player has won the gentlemen\u2019s singles \ntwice, in 1985 and 2001,and the ladies\u2019 singles once, in 2023. 14 unseeded players have \nreached the final of the gentlemen\u2019s singles (including Kurt Nielsen of Denmark, who \nachieved this twice) and five unseeded players have reached the final of the ladies\u2019 singles. \n14 unseeded pairs have won the gentlemen\u2019s doubles, nine unseeded pairs have won the \nladies\u2019 doubles and 14 unseeded pairs have won the mixed doubles. \nSince 1975, seeding has been based on computer rankings. Since 2001, 32 players have \nbeen seeded in the gentlemen\u2019s and ladies\u2019 singles. \nFrom 2002\u20132019, seeding in the gentlemen\u2019s singles was determined by a surface-based \nsystem. The top 32 players in the world rankings were guaranteed to be seeded, however \ntheir exact placing was adjusted according to a formula that took into account grass court \nform over the previous two years. \nFor the ladies\u2019 singles, the seeding order followed the world ranking list, except where, in \nthe opinion of the Committee, the grass court credentials of a particular player necessitated \na change in the interest of achieving a balanced draw. \nSince 2021, seeding for both the gentlemen\u2019s and ladies\u2019 singles draws has been based \nsolely on world ranking.\n \nFor full details of seeding positions from The Championships over the years, please visit  \nwww.wimbledon.com.\nSEEDED PLAYERS IN THE CONCLUDING ROUNDS\nThe following tables reveal the progress of seeded players in the concluding rounds of The \nChampionships since full seeding was first introduced in 1927, with the numbers used \ndenoting a player\u2019s seeding postion, e.g. the Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship 1927 was \nwon by the No.4 seed, France\u2019s Henri Cochet."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

The procedure was \nabandoned after 2006 and the system of wild cards being allocated directly by the Committee \nresumed.

The entries fell into two categories, one consisting of the \nplayers nominated by their national associations and the other individual entries. The former \nwere accepted without question, but the latter were subjected to a careful scrutiny by a sub-\ncommittee of five, including the Referee.\nIn 1925 a Qualifying Competition for the five Championship events was held for the \nfirst time, during the week before, at the Roehampton Club, London. In singles the last \neight survivors qualified and, in the doubles, the last four pairs. In 1927 an additional \nQualifying Competition was held in the North of England, restricted to entries from \nnorthern counties and Scotland. In the singles the last two survivors qualified and, in the \ndoubles, the last pair.\nQualifying was not held in 1946 but both the Southern and Northern competitions were \nreinstated for the 1947 Championships. In 1966 the Northern competition was held for the \nlast time and since that date Qualifying has taken place in the south. \nThere was no qualifying for the gentlemen\u2019s doubles and mixed doubles in 1973, owing to \nthe A.T .P . boycott, and for the mixed doubles in 1977, when the ladies\u2019 singles and doubles \nwere played at Eastbourne simultaneously with the Federation Cup. Qualifying for the mixed \ndoubles was discontinued after 1991, and both gentlemen\u2019s and ladies\u2019 doubles Qualifying was \ndiscontinued after 2018.\n From 1925 to date all matches involving ladies have been contested over the best of \nthree sets. From 1925 to 1971 the gentlemen\u2019s singles and doubles matches were contested \nthroughout over the best of five sets. From 1972 to date, with the exception of 1973, 1993, \n1997 and 1998 these matches were reduced to the best of three sets except in the last round, \nwhere they were contested over the best of five sets. In 1973 (A.T .P . boycott), 1993, 1997 \nand 1998 (rain) the best of three sets were played throughout. \nAcceptance for the Qualifying Competition has been by computer ranking since 1977. \nSeeding began in 1978.\nFrom 1983 to 2003 the Lawn Tennis Association held Pre-Qualifying singles events, two \nweeks before The Championships. For further details, see \u2018Events No Longer Held\u2019.\nLUCKY LOSERS\n \nLucky Losers are players who have lost in the final round of the Qualifying Competition and, \nif more Lucky Losers are required for substitutes, those players who have lost in the previous \nqualifying round. A Lucky Loser is inserted in The Championships draw as a substitution \nfor a player who withdraws before their first round match. The procedure originated in 1937 \nwhen Lucky Losers were drawn by lot (hence the name), but from 1977\u20132005, players with \nthe highest ranking were substituted first, and so on. In 2006 and 2007, the top four highest \nranked players were randomly drawn and thereafter followed the ranking. In 2008 all players \nwere randomly drawn. From 2009 the four highest ranked players have been randomly drawn \nand thereafter follow the rankings, unless there are more than two vacancies, in which case the \nsize of the random draw will be the number of vacancies plus two. Similar arrangements are \nmade for the doubles events. Up to 1936 players withdrawing from The Championships, after \nthe draw had been made, were not replaced."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

These \nevents are staged in partnership with the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour and the AEL TC is \nproud to welcome the world\u2019s best players to compete on grass for the chance to become a \nWimbledon champion. \nFor full details of the various Wheelchair Tennis Champions at The Championships over the years, \nplease see page 110.\nJunior Championships\n \nOriginally in 1947 the Committee of Management invited 18 junior champions from 10 \nEuropean countries to watch the second week\u2019s play during The Championships.\nIn the mornings Dan Maskell, the Club Professional, organised an American tournament \nfor the boys and girls on the hard courts. The boys\u2019 event was won by 16-year-old Kurt \nNielsen of Denmark. His prize was a small silver cup, donated by Maskell, which was \npresented by the newly crowned Wimbledon Champion, Jack Kramer. The girls\u2019 winner was \nGenevieve Domken of Belgium, who received a prize, donated by Dr. Colin Gregory.\nThe juniors were invited again in 1948 and, as in the previous year, competitions took \nplace on the hard courts during the mornings. In 1949 the two events were held in public on \nthe outside grass courts during the afternoons of the second week under normal knockout \nconditions. This practice has continued ever since, with both events raised to Championship \nstatus in 1975. Seeding began in 1977. For the first time in 1998 a Qualifying Competition \nfor the Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Singles, for up to 48 in each event, was held at the Bank of England \nSports Club during the first week of The Championships.\nIn 2022, the Junior Championships expanded with the inclusion of a 14-and-under \ndraw, providing promising players with a unique opportunity to play on grass early in their \njunior careers. 16 boys and 16 girls from across the world compete on the Championships \ncourts at the All England Club during the second week of the tournament. The AEL TC \nworks with Regional Associations and Grand Slam nations to allocate the places to ensure \nrepresentation from across the globe. \nThe 14-and-under draw is a round-robin singles event with four groups of four players, \nguaranteeing at least three matches per player.

A Supplementary Agreement in 1950 dealt \nentirely with financial matters which arose in the course of previous arrangements. In 1966 \nthe Principal Agreement was updated by the amendment of a few specific minor provisions \nto meet changing conditions; the number of the L TA\u2019s nominees to the Joint Committee of \nManagement was increased to seven and the Agreement extended to at least 1999.\n1993\nThe 1934 Agreement was varied by a Deed of Variation to give effect to changes appropriate \nto the circumstances in the 1990s and beyond: it expired on 31 July 2013.

The \u2018A\u2019 Debentures carried an interest rate of 7.5 per cent \nper annum, redeemable in or before August 1947, and also conferred on the holder the \nright to purchase one seat in the Centre Court Stand for each day of The Championships \nup to and including 1947, at the prices current at such meetings. The \u2018B\u2019 Debentures \ncarried no interest but conferred upon the holder the right, without payment, to one seat \nin the Centre Court Stand for a similar period. The Debenture issue was oversubscribed \nand increased to \u00a3100,000. Because of the Second World War, the Debentures were \nextended by six years until the end of The Championships 1953.\nIn 1948, existing holders were offered the opportunity of extending their rights until \nThe Championships 1959 with a new issue of 2,100 Debentures at \u00a350 each. Money was \nrequired to effect repairs to the Club\u2019s premises, including bomb damage, none having \nbeen carried out for nine years, and to improve the Centre Court and catering facilities.\nSo the process has continued and, apart from one year only, 1960, Debentures have \nbeen issued every five years. The three issues of 2,100 Debentures for 1986\u20131990, 1991\u2013\n1995 and 1996\u20132000 realised approximately \u00a310.5 million, \u00a331.5 million and \u00a330.7 \nmillion, respectively. Arising from the extension of the west side of the Centre Court, \nan additional 200 Debentures, making a total of 2,300, were offered for 2001\u20132005 and \n2006\u20132010. Following the further increase in capacity, resulting from the completion \nof the Centre Court redevelopment in 2008, an additional 200 debentures, making a \ntotal of 2,500, were offered for 2011\u20132015 and 2016\u20132020. These realised \u00a355 million \nand \u00a3100 million respectively. In March 2019, the Company announced the 2021\u20132025 \nseries of 2,520 Centre Court Debentures which raised \u00a3163.8 million. The most recent \nissue of 2,520 debentures for 2026\u20132030 will raise \u00a3239.4 million.\nSince the late 1970s, income from Debentures has funded many major works \nprogrammes to provide expanded and improved facilities for the players, spectators, \nofficials and media, such as: 1979 \u2013 Raising of the Centre Court roof and the construction \nof a new Debenture Holders\u2019 Lounge on the north side of Centre Court, 1980 \u2013 \nMembers\u2019 Enclosure made a permanent building, 1981 \u2013 No.1 Court Competitors\u2019 \nComplex rebuilt, 1985 \u2013 East Side Centre Court Building constructed, 1986 \u2013 new two-\nstorey Pavilion in Aorangi Park, 1989 \u2013 three new covered courts, 1991 \u2013 Centre Court \nNorth Building extended to provide greater accommodation for Debenture Holders and \noffices, 1992 \u2013 Replacement of Centre Court roof, 2009 \u2013 development of Centre Court \nincluding a retractable roof and new No.2 Court, 2019 \u2013 redevelopment of No.1 Court \nincluding retractable roof, 2019 \u2013 new Indoor Tennis Centre, 2022 \u2013 construction of \nMedia Pavilion.\nIn recent years, further funding has been provided by the issue of Debentures for the \nnew No.1 Court. The issue of 1,000 Debentures for 1997\u20132001 realised \u00a38 million, 834 \nDebentures for 2002\u20132006 realised \u00a36.7 million, 850 Debentures for 2007\u20132011 realised \n\u00a38.5 million, and 1,000 Debentures for 2012\u20132016 realised \u00a311 million. In 2016 the issue \nof 1,000 Debentures for 2017\u20132021 realised \u00a325 million.

This was presented to The All England Croquet and \nLawn Tennis Club, especially for the event, by The Field newspaper. J.H. Walsh, the \nHonorary Secretary of the Club and the editor of The Field, who persuaded his Proprietors \nto support the new venture by providing the 25 guineas Cup.\nThe Cup, which is made of sterling silver, stands 14\u00bd inches high, with a base diameter \nof 6 inches and a rim diameter of 7\u00bd inches. The hallmark, beneath the rim, indicates a date \nof 1877. The Cup has two handles and a raised foot. Decoration consists of two crossed \ntennis rackets and three tennis balls at the front, below which lies the following inscription:\nThe All England Lawn Tennis Challenge Cup Presented by the Proprietors of The\nField For competition by Amateurs Wimbledon July 1877\nThe reverse of the Cup is engraved with the dates and names of the Champions from \n1877 to 1883, the last being William Renshaw, who having won The Championships three \ntimes in succession was permitted under the regulations to keep it. The Field Cup is on \ndisplay in Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum.\nCHALLENGE CUP (AELTC), 1884\u20131886\nAfter The Championships 1883, the All England Lawn Tennis Club purchased a new 50 \nguineas Challenge Cup to replace the trophy retired by William Renshaw. As with The Field \nCup, regulations stated that the Cup would be held for one year but if won by the same \nplayer in three successive years would become their property.\nRenshaw won this second Challenge Cup in three successive years, 1884\u20131886, and \nconsequently retired the trophy. Details and whereabouts of the trophy are unknown.\nCHALLENGE CUP (AELTC), 1887 TO DATE\nThe All England Lawn Tennis Club spent 100 guineas from the profits of The \nChampionships 1886 to purchase a new trophy. The Club was not prepared to risk losing a \nthird Cup to a future three-times Champion so the decision was taken that the new trophy \nwould \u201cnever become the property of the winner\u201d.\nThe Cup, which is silver gilt, stands 18 inches high and has a diameter of 7\u00bd inches. It \nweighs 3.5kg (6.2kg including its plinth). The hallmark indicates a date of 1883. The Cup has a \nclassical style with two handles and a raised foot. The lid is formed with a pineapple on the top \nand there is a head wearing a winged helmet beneath each handle. There are two decorative \nborders with floral work and ovolo mouldings on the bowl of the Cup and on the handles.\nThe inscription on the Cup reads:\nThe All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Championship of the World\nAround the bowl are engraved the dates and names of the Champions. Although \nHerbert Lawford was the first Champion to win the Cup in 1887, the decision was taken to \nengrave all the Champions\u2019 names from 1877. In 2009, there being no space left to engrave \nfurther names of the Champions, a black plinth with an ornamented silver gilt band was \ndesigned to accompany the Cup."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

From 2007, all Champions have received a three-quarter size replica of the Cup \nbearing the names of all past Champions (height 13\u00bd inches).\nTHE RENSHAW CUP, 1905\u20131989\nThe Renshaw Cup, a prize rather than a trophy, was won outright annually. This Cup \nwas originally presented to The All England Lawn Tennis Club in 1905 by the surviving \nmembers of the family of Ernest and William Renshaw, who contributed so much to lawn \ntennis in the 1880s, as First Prize to the winner of the All Comers\u2019 Singles. However, \nfrom 1922, when the Challenge Round was abolished, until 1989, the Cup was presented \nto the Champion.\nOriginally the Cup stood 10 inches high with a base diameter of 4\u00bd inches and the bowl \ndiameter, rim to rim, of 7 inches. From 1953, the practice of presenting a \u2018full-size\u2019 Cup \nceased and instead the Champion received a miniature replica (height 5 inches).\nThe Cup was originally manufactured by Messrs. Elkington and Co. Ltd. of \nBirmingham, in sterling silver, with a value of \u00a320. The design consists of an octagonal base, \nsupporting a round plinth on which stands a winged, mercurial figure with arms stretched \nupwards to support the bowl of the Cup. The first winner in 1905, was Norman Brookes \nof Australia. Examples of the Renshaw Cup can be seen on display in Wimbledon Lawn \nTennis Museum.\nTHE PRESIDENT\u2019S CUP, 1908\u20131994\nThe Championships 1907 was particularly memorable because The All England Lawn \nTennis Club was honoured by the presence of Their Royal Highnesses The Prince and \nPrincess of Wales. As a result of this visit, Prince George, later King George V, became \nPresident of the Club and expressed a wish to present a \u201cperpetual Challenge Cup\u201d to be \ncompeted for annually at The Championships. The Committee decided that the trophy \nshould be held for the year by the winner of the All Comers\u2019 Singles.\nThe Cup stands 17 inches high and is 7\u00bd inches in diameter. This silver trophy has a lid \nand a raised foot.\nThe inscription on the Cup reads:\nPresented by George, Prince of W ales, to the All England Lawn Tennis Club to be held for the year \nby the Winner of the All Comers\u2019 Singles Championship of the World.\nThe wording of this inscription is rather ambiguous. From 1908 to 1921, the last \nyear of the Challenge Round, the winner of the All Comers\u2019 Singles did not become \nChampion of the World \u2013 only if he defeated the defending Champion. When the \nChallenge Round was abolished in 1922 the defending Champion had to \u201cplay through\u201d \nand there was no longer an All Comers\u2019 Singles. From then to 1994, the Champion \nbecame the holder of the President\u2019s Cup and the Challenge Cup (AEL TC). After 1994, \nthe President\u2019s Cup was retired.\nThe dates and names of the winners of the All Comers\u2019 Singles, from Arthur Gore in \n1908 to 1921, and the dates and names of the Champions, 1922\u20131994 are engraved on the \nbowl of the Cup.\nFrom 1949 to 1994, all Champions received a miniature replica of the Cup (height  \n9 inches)."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Earlier in that year the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club had \ndecided, owing to lack of support, to discontinue their championship, which had been \ninstituted in 1879, and offered to transfer the Challenge Cup to The All England Lawn \nTennis Club.

The salver, which is made of sterling silver, partly gilded, is 18\u00be inches \nin diameter. It weighs 2.3kg (4.5kg including its plinth). There is a central boss surrounded by \nfour reserves, with eight on the spreading rim. The remainder of the surface is decorated with \ngilt renaissance strapwork and foliate motifs in relief against a rigid silver ground.\nThe theme of the decoration is mythological. The central boss has a figure of \nTemperance, seated on a chest with a lamp in her right hand and a jug in her left, with \nvarious attributes such as a sickle, fork and caduceus around her. The four reserves on \nthe boss of the dish each contain a classical god, together with attribute, Venus, Jupiter, \nMercury and Water Goddess, representing the four elements. The reserves around the rim \nshow Minerva presiding over the seven Liberal Arts: Astrology, Geometry, Arithmetic, \nMusic, Rhetoric, Dialectic and Grammar, each with relevant attribute.

A plinth consisting of an oval hardwood base, having a glass ebonised \nfinish, was commissioned. A sterling silver inscription band is affixed which allows space \nfor further engraving.\nFrom 1949 to 2006, all Champions received a miniature replica of the trophy (diameter \n8 inches). From 2007, all Champions have received a three-quarter size replica of the \ntrophy, bearing the names of all past Champions (diameter 14 inches).\nOver the years the Club has received many enquiries from people who possess salvers made \nto a design identical to that of the Ladies\u2019 Singles Plate. Some have been made in silver and \nothers in copper or tin. Since these salvers are \u2018electrotypes\u2019 created by electric deposition of \ncopper on a mould, it is reasonable to assume that Elkingtons made many.

The All England Lawn Tennis Club agreed to merge these Championships with the \nthree existing Championships and to extend the programme to include Ladies\u2019 Doubles and \nMixed Doubles Championships.\nThe L TA decided to present two silver Challenge Trophies to the winners of each new \nevent.

They were \npresented in a box with the Wimbledon logo.\n \n \nSILVER SALVERS\n   \nFrom 1987 the runners-up of the five Championship events have received a silver salver, on \nwhich is engraved a view of the Clubhouse and Centre Court building. The diameter of the \nsalvers are: Singles, 1987\u20131997 \u2013 10 inches, 1998 to date \u2013 14 inches. Doubles, 1987 to date \n\u2013 8 inches. \nOriginally the engraving showed one Clubhouse balcony, but from 2002 the design was \nchanged to incorporate two new side balconies.\nSince 2022, the Champions of the Invitation Doubles events have received a new, square-\nshaped salver.\n \nENGRAVING\n \nImmediately the Champions and runners-up of the events at The Championships are \nknown, the replica trophies and salvers are engraved, enabling the players to leave with \nthem in their possession.\nPRESENTATION\n \nThe practice of presenting the Trophy to the Singles Champions on the Centre Court \noriginated in 1949, when on Friday 1 July, H.R.H. The Duchess of Kent, President of The \nAll England Lawn Tennis Club, consented to go down onto the Centre Court for the \nceremony and so \u201cgive the photographers a break\u2019\u2019. Ted Schroeder of the United States \nwas the recipient. \nOn the following day the Duchess of Kent presented the Ladies\u2019 Singles trophy to \nLouise Brough in the Royal Box but later in the afternoon she went on Court to present \nthe Ladies\u2019 Doubles Trophy (which she had just donated to the Club) to Louise Brough \nand Margaret duPont. From 1946 to 1948 the trophies were presented in the Royal \nBox. Previously, the trophies were not presented in private or public, but occasionally \nthe champions and runners-up were summoned to the Royal Box to receive the Royal \ncongratulations. \nFrom 1950 to 1953 there was no set pattern and the Gentlemen\u2019s and Ladies\u2019 Singles \ntrophy was presented either in the Royal Box or on Court. \nIn 1954 both singles champions received their trophy on Court and this has been the \npractice ever since. Quite often in the fifties and early sixties the winners of the doubles \nevents received their trophies on Court but until 2021, with the exception of 1973 \n(Gentlemen\u2019s Doubles) and 2000 (Ladies\u2019 Doubles), the ceremonies always took place in \nthe Royal Box. Since 2021 all trophy presentations have taken place on Court. The change \nwas initially in response to Covid-19 protocols."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Initially the execution of the work was carried out by Messrs. \nFattorini and Sons, medallists of Bradford and London, who produced the die and the \nfinished medal, which is 1.5 inches diameter.\nThe obverse side of the medal is intended to be a symbolical interpretation of the World\u2019s \nLawn Tennis Championships on Grass. The kneeling figure represents Merit, bearing a \nfigure of Victory in the left hand, while the right hand is in the act of plucking a laurel \nwreath from the globe. Lawn Tennis is indicated by the net and the open air by the sun in \nthe background. The oak leaves in the foreground stand for strength and endurance. Around \nthe figure are the words WORLD\u2019S LAWN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS ON GRASS. \nOn the reverse side is engraved the year, event and name/s of the recipient/s, around which \nis a foliate design.\nThe medal was presented in 1913, 1914 and from 1919 to 1923, after which the title \nWorld\u2019s Championship on Grass ceased to exist. From 1924 the design of the medal on the \nobverse side was altered by the deletion of the words \u2018WORLD\u2019S CHAMPIONSHIPS \nON GRASS and on the reverse side by the replacement of the foliate design with the words \nTHE LAWN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS.\nFrom 1913 to 1921, gold, silver and bronze medals were presented, but from 1922, when \nthe Challenge Round was abolished, gold medals were presented to the champions and \nsilver medals to the runners-up. The whole practice ceased after 1939.\nTraditionally the presenter of the singles trophies has been escorted on to the Centre \nCourt by the Chairman and Secretary/Chief Executive of the AEL TC and the President \nof the L TA. There have been very few exceptions. From the mid-seventies until recent \nyears, the custom was for both the Duke and Duchess of Kent to go on Court, irrespective \nof which one of them was making the presentation. Following the retirement of the Duke \nas AEL TC President after The Championships 2021, H.R.H. The Princess of Wales, as \nthe Club\u2019s Patron, presents the gentlemen\u2019s and ladies\u2019 singles trophies whenever available. \nFrom 1946 to 1967 the Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Champion was presented with the \nPresident\u2019s Cup but from 1968 to date the AEL TC Challenge Cup has been preferred, as \nthe delicate gold colouring of the trophy shows to better advantage on colour television.\nFor details of on-court presentations made at The Championships after each event,  \nrefer to The Champions section on page 26."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

The two world wars are responsible for the majority of \nthese gaps, with the First World War resulting in the suspension of The Championships \nbetween 1915 and 1918, and the Second World War causing a six-year pause between \n1940 and 1945. The most recent cancellation was, of course, a result of the global \nCovid-19 pandemic, which prevented the 134th Championships from being held in 2020.\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914, the sport of lawn tennis was \nreaching new heights of popularity, with The Championships becoming an increasingly \ninternational event. Norman Brookes of Australia had just defeated New Zealand\u2019s \nAnthony Wilding to deny his fellow Australasian his fifth consecutive gentlemen\u2019s singles \ntitle. The only problem on the horizon for the AEL TC was that its Worple Road ground \nwas clearly too small to cope with the huge crowds. \nHowever, any plans to find a new ground were put on hold by the outbreak of war. For \nthe next five years, it was only thanks to the generosity of its Members and the efforts of \nClub President Henry Wilson-Fox that the AEL TC survived. Meanwhile, Wilding, one \nof the first great superstars of tennis, who had joined the Royal Marines on the outbreak \nof war, was killed at Neuve Chapelle on 9 May 1915. A plaque commemorating Wilding \nand other AEL TC Members killed during the two world wars is situated on the ground \nfloor of the Clubhouse. \nIt is slightly ironic that, when play resumed at Wimbledon in 1919, the world was \nalso emerging from a global pandemic, with tens of millions of people having died from \nSpanish flu. Nevertheless, The Championships picked up where they left off and, led by \nnew stars such as Suzanne Lenglen, continued to go from strength to strength. \nTwenty years later, however, play was suspended once again, with the outbreak of the \nSecond World War. Nevertheless, the Club, under a skeleton staff led by Acting Secretary \nNorah Cleather, remained open to Members. Cleather\u2019s autobiography, Wimbledon Story, \ncontains perhaps the best written account of Wimbledon during wartime. It describes \nhow the Club was \nused for a variety \nof civil defence and \nmilitary purposes, \nsuch as fire and \nambulance services \nand the Home \nGuard. There was \neven a small farmyard \non the site of the old \ncar parks.\nTowards the \nend of the war, in \na sign that things \nCANCELLED CHAMPIONSHIPS\nRight: British Red \nCross nurses and \nvolunteers pictured at \nthe Club during the \nSecond World W ar"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

When The Championships recommenced in 1946, service personnel were \nemployed as stewards for the first time, a tradition which continues to this day.\nThe AEL TC did not come through the war entirely unscathed. On 11 October 1940, \nthe roof of Centre Court was hit by a 500-pound bomb. Due to the rationing of building \nsupplies, it wasn\u2019t until 1949 that the damage could be fully repaired, resulting in the loss \nof around 1,200 seats for the first three post-war Championships.\nThe involvement of the AEL TC in the war effort was, in many ways, echoed in \nthe Club\u2019s reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Once it became clear that The \nChampionships 2020 could not go ahead, attention immediately turned to how the Club \ncould use its resources to help with the response to the crisis. Meals were donated to those \nin need in the local community and the famous Wimbledon strawberries were donated to \nlocal hospitals. Balls were donated to tennis clubs and schools and towels were donated to \ncharities supporting the homeless.\nOne thing that is clear from all the cancellations of The Championships is that absence \nmakes the heart grow fonder. It takes more than a world war or a global pandemic to \ndampen the public\u2019s enthusiasm for Wimbledon. \nRight: Adam \nFargin, Executive \nChef at the \nAELTC, hands over \nChristmas meals to \nlocal charity City \nHarvest during the \nCovid-19 pandemic\nAbove: The programme for The Championships 1946 included details of bomb damage to Centre Court"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

The equitable distribution of tickets is inevitably a subject \nthat causes much debate both within the All England Club and outside. However, only \ndebenture holders, Members of the Club, and Council Members of the Lawn Tennis \nAssociation obtain them as a matter of right. Special allocations are made to the Lawn \nTennis Association\u2019s Advantage members, formerly known as British Tennis Membership, \nand to other organisations with special claims. A set number of Show Court tickets are \nallocated to schools affiliated with the Lawn Tennis Association. A substantial proportion \nof the total number of tickets is retained for issue to the general public in advance via the \nWimbledon Public Ballot, first introduced in 1924, and which launched online in the \nautumn of 2019. \nWimbledon remains one of the very few major sporting events where you can buy \npremium tickets on the day of play. Each day a large Queue forms to buy either one of the \nlimited Show Court tickets available, or a Grounds Pass. Tickets are sold on a best available, \none per person queuing basis and are non-transferable.\nFive hundred tickets for Centre Court (excluding the last four days), No.1 Court, and \nNo.2 Court are available for each day the courts are in play. Grounds Passes are also sold, \nenabling access to all courts including No.3 Court, Court 12 and Court 18, as well as \nThe Hill, where the big screen shows action from Centre Court and No.1 Court. Entry \ncontinues until the Grounds reach capacity. This varies each day depending on the number \nof courts in play and the weather. Once capacity is reached, entry may only be possible as \npeople leave the Grounds for the day.\nTicket Resale is available within the Grounds with guests often able to obtain a \nticket for a reserved seat on Centre Court, No.1 Court or No.2 Court for the balance of \nthe day\u2019s play. The tickets, subject to availability, are re-sold at a small charge with the \nproceeds going to the Wimbledon Foundation. Prices for 2025 remain at \u00a315 for Centre \nCourt and \u00a310 for No.1 Court and No.2 Court. Resale tickets are not sold before 3pm, \nwith the majority of tickets available after 5pm when guests begin to leave the Grounds. \nThe Ticket Resale queue operated virtually for the first time at The Championships 2024, \nallowing guests to join remotely rather than having to stand in a physical queue for hours. \nOnce registered, guests receive a text message, based on their position in the queue, when \ntickets start to be become available.\nTicket initiatives for recent Championships include a Community Scheme, which \nprovides access to tickets across all 14 days for guests living locally to Wimbledon, and a \nFamily Ballot, providing access to tickets to the final days of The Championships on No.1 \nCourt, also for local families. \nTiered pricing has also been introduced, with three different ticket prices staggered \nacross Centre Court and No.1 Court according to proximity to the playing surface. Mobile \nticketing, which was accelerated for The Championships 2021 due to the Covid-19 \npandemic, continues into its fifth year. \nTicket integrity remains of the highest importance to The All England Lawn Tennis \nClub and as such the Ticket Terms and Conditions must be adhered to when applying for \nand purchasing tickets. Full refunds are offered up to 24 hours before the day of play, should \nguests find themselves in the position of being unable to attend.

During the three weeks of \nThe Championships (including Qualifying) there are approximately 124 British Officials, \nlicensed by the L TA, and approximately 67 international officials from all over the world, \nincluding the team of eight ITF Grand Slam Chair Umpires who officiate at all four \nGrand Slams, and one full-time ATP Chair Umpire. Both Tours (ATP and WTA) have a \nsignificant number of their representatives working as on-court officials.\n \nON-COURT OFFICIALS \n \nThere are 46 officials at The Championships working as Chair Umpires who are graded \nGold, Silver or Bronze.

The teams work on a timed rotation: three or four Match \nAssistants and two Review Officials are assigned to each of the 18 courts.\nChair Umpires use computers to score the match, each point scored being displayed \nautomatically on scoreboards around the Grounds and on the Club\u2019s website and app. The \nresponsibility for calling net cords now rests with the Chair Umpire.

If the set went to a tie break, players \nwere given additional opportunities to challenge. In order for the players, officials and \nspectators to see the replays, large screen video boards were installed.

Wood}\nREFEREE\u2019S SYSTEMS\n \nThe Referee\u2019s Office systems support all aspects of the operation from the entry of competitors, \nthe draws, the scheduling of matches, recording results and the payment of prize money.\nThe daily Order of Play was previously prepared using the \u2018Womble\u2019 board which \nallowed the Referee to plan matches on up to 20 courts, checking to ensure that there were \nno clashes for competitors in several events. In 2010, the Womble Board was replaced by a \nnew panoramic HD video wall display in the Referee\u2019s Office, which allowed several of the \nReferee\u2019s team to schedule matches for different events simultaneously.\nThe Chair Umpire uses a scorepad system, introduced in 2001, which allows them to score \na match directly from the chair, thus providing real-time scores to the rest of the systems. In \n2014, a new, larger tablet-style PDA was used by umpires at Qualifying and at the main site. \nLinked to the Order of Play is an Umpire\u2019s system. This helps in the allocation of the officials \nfor each court during The Championships. By using a wireless network, the Referee\u2019s Systems \nwhich are in use at the Qualifying competition were expanded, to feed live scores to the Club \nand the Wimbledon website. \nIn 2013, the wireless connections were replaced by ethernet cables which were felt to \nprovide a more reliable feed of up-to-date scores from Qualifying. The Referee\u2019s systems \nhave been largely rewritten in phases since 2014, moving to a modern technical architecture. \nThe live draw software was completely rewritten in 2017, with a better graphical interface \nincluding up-to-date player images and brief biographical details for the media who attend the \nlive event, which is usually scheduled on the Friday before The Championships. The Umpire\u2019s \nallocation software and the Referee\u2019s scheduling software were rewritten and used for the first \ntime in 2021.\nThe Referee\u2019s Office systems were replaced again in 2024, using modern cloud integration \ntechnology to connect to other Championships systems. The introduction of full electronic \nline calling in 2025 fundamentally changes the requirements for the Umpire\u2019s allocation \nsoftware and hence a new software package has been introduced to meet the needs of the \nChief Umpire\u2019s team.\nNotes: From 1963 to 1976 there was no officially appointed Assistant Referee. During this period the following \npeople assisted the Referee at various times: T .R. Kirkpatrick, B.J. Austin, M. Seaton, \nF.W. Hoyles, J.R. Cochrane, B.M. Seal and T .D. Gathercole."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Both locations did not provide a visual indication. \nHowever, in 1999 spectators on both courts were able immediately to see the speed of \nplayers\u2019 service when displayed in units installed at ground level at both ends of each court. \nThis facility was extended to No.2 and No.18 Courts in 2001 and No.3 and No.12 Courts \nin 2003. From 2008 the displays on Centre and No.1 Courts were replaced with video \nboards and this was extended to the new No.2 Court in 2009 and the new No.3 Court in \n2011. In 2025, service speeds are no longer measured by a radar gun. The Hawk-Eye ball \ntracking system measures the speed of every stroke, including the service. This measurement \ncontinues to be displayed for spectators on the six show courts.\nOFFICIALS\u2019 UNIFORMS\n \nToday\u2019s Wimbledon Officials take to the courts resplendent in their Ralph Lauren uniforms. \nBut it wasn\u2019t until 1976 that uniforms were introduced. \n1976 The Umpires and Line Judges appeared for the first time wearing their new uniform of \nnavy blue blazer and grey trousers or skirts. \n \n1981 A special Wimbledon uniform for Umpires and Line Judges was introduced \u2013 dark \ngreen jackets and light green trousers or skirts.\n1999 The Umpires and Line Judges wore a new uniform in two combinations: Gentlemen \u2013 \ngreen blazer, khaki trousers, shirt and tie or sweater, khaki trousers, shirt and tie. Ladies \u2013 green \njacket, skirt and blouse, or khaki trousers, blouse and sweater. \n2006 A new Chair and Line Umpire\u2019s uniform was introduced, designed by Polo Ralph \nLauren, featuring a navy blue retro blazer, piped in cream and a navy blue and white striped \nshirt with white collar. The men wore cream pleated \u2018Oxford Bags\u2019 with turn-ups, while the \nwomen chose similar trousers or a cream panelled skirt. The traditional colours of green and \npurple were used on the men\u2019s striped tie and on the blazer badge of crossed rackets. Cream \ncanvas shoes completed the outfit. \n2016 A new uniform for the Chair and Line Umpires was introduced. The design, by Ralph \nLauren, featured a navy blazer with pinstripes and a jumper with purple and green stripes \naround the v-neck. Sunglasses, featuring dark green nuances and a purple Polo Pony logo, \nwere introduced to the uniform for the first time.\n2022 A new Ralph Lauren Umpires\u2019 uniform was introduced, featuring a belted back sports \ncoat lined with a commemorative Ralph Lauren designed signature Wimbledon print and \nadorned with both Polo Ralph Lauren and Wimbledon emblems. This is paired with a wide \nBengal stripe shirt that includes recycled material and stylish white trousers or white skirt with \npearl button closure. Line umpire uniforms were refreshed with navy cardigans featuring a \nwhite and Wimbledon green striped cuff detail which includes recycled COOLMAX\u00ae fibres, \nproviding superior comfort in warm environments with moisture management properties.\n2025 The new Match Assistants will wear the same Polo Ralph Lauren uniform worn by \nLine Umpires in previous years."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Over the years, however, numerous features have been \nincorporated to assist them in their duties.\n \n1927 Public address equipment was used from the Centre Court Umpire\u2019s chair for the first time.\n \n2002 After experimenting for several years at The Championships, Chair Umpires used an \nelectronic scorepad, connected to a central computer, to score matches on all courts for the \nfirst time. On No.18 Court the scoreboard, being electronic, was updated directly from the \nChair Umpire\u2019s scorepad. The scorepad replaced the traditional hand-written scorecard.\n \n2006 A facility was added to allow Chair Umpires on the Centre and No.1 Court to \nimmediately update the electronic scoreboards on court from the scorepad.\n2022 A newly redesigned umpires\u2019 chair was introduced on Centre and No.1 Courts. The \nnew chair was designed to accommodate all the technology and broadcast equipment in a \nconsidered and discreet manner whilst encompassing some of the construction details of \ntraditional wooden tennis racquets. Great care was taken to accommodate the operational \nrequirements of the chair, whilst maintaining the proportions required for good sightlines, \nimproving comfort and making it quickly manoeuvrable should there be a rain delay.\nThe new design embraced both Wimbledon\u2019s heritage and the technological advances \nin equipment that modern tennis now demands, bringing up-to-date an essential piece of \nequipment that had changed very little since the earliest models in the 1920s.\n2023 The new-style chairs on Centre and No.1 Courts were modified slightly following \nfeedback from stakeholders. The old-style chairs on the remaining courts were refreshed and \nfeatured a solid side panel.\nBALL BOYS AND GIRLS\n \nIn the 1920s and 1930s Ball Boys were provided by Shaftesbury Homes. From 1946 to 1966 \nthey were provided by Dr Barnardo\u2019s Homes and in 1967 and 1968 by Shaftesbury Homes \nagain. Since 1969 they have been provided by local schools. The number of Ball Boys/Girls \nhas grown steadily over the years from the late 1930s, when 46 were employed. In 1995 the \nfigure noticeably increased from 138 to 182 to allow a full allocation of six to a court and in \n2007 the number reached 250. Ball Girls were first introduced in 1977, and mixed teams in \n1980. In 1986 Ball Girls were used on Centre Court for the first time. \nCurrently, approximately 280 Ball Boys and Girls (BBGs) are selected from around 1,500 \napplicants, with 170 from Year 9 and 10 applicants and 110 from recall applications (i.e. \nBBGs who have been accepted at one of the last two Championships). The ratio of boys to \ngirls is approximately 50:50. BBG training is directed by Sarah Goldson, who has held the \nrole since 2012.\nSELECTION\nParticipating schools make the initial nominations of the BBGs and are asked to send \ncandidates who meet the following requirements: \nHave completed the first eight modules of the online training programme \nand registered their details online; are in Year 9 or 10; have no exams during The "}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Fitness: complete the warm-up, consisting of jogging, running and dynamic  \n exercises, followed by standing still for several minutes. Candidates are then assessed  \n in a series of speed endurance tests.\n 2. Knowledge: assessed through a written test on the rules and scoring of tennis.\n 3. Court work: demonstrate a basic understanding of the game and the ability to  \n perform the core skills, when adopting one of the key BBG positions, i.e. base  \n or centre.\n 4. Skills: demonstrate competency in feeding, rolling and receiving over a variety  \n of distances.\nCompetition for places is extremely high at selection and the margin between success and \nfailure can be a matter of 1-2 points.\nTRAINING\nIn a usual year, training begins in February at the AEL TC Community Tennis Centre, \nRaynes Park, and each prospective BBG will train once a week. Weekly training sessions \nlast between 2\u20132.5 hours, with 40-80 BBGs per session. There is no training during the \nschool holidays.\nTraining sessions involve general fitness and movement exercises, circuits, core skills \n(rolling, feeding, receiving, working on knowledge of the game), scoring (e.g. knowing \nfrom the score at which end the balls should be), and set pieces (marching, start and end \nof match, tie-break, ball change, suspended play etc.)  Throughout training, each candidate \nis constantly assessed by the instructor team and is also expected to analyse their own \nperformance and record any key aspects to work on.\nAfter May half-term, in the run up to The Championships, training moves to the \nAEL TC\u2019s Indoor Tennis Centre, Somerset Road. Training on grass only happens towards \nthe end of the programme and includes a grass court week on both the Championships \ncourts and at Aorangi during the Wildcard Playoffs. In 2022, the BBGs took part in the \nQualifying Competition for the first time, providing BBGs for between 10-12 courts across \nthe four days. This is now a permanent part of the BBG calendar.\nDURING THE CHAMPIONSHIPS\nSix teams of six, selected by Sarah Goldson, are responsible for Centre & No.1 Courts and \nsix teams of six rotate around the other Show Courts. The remainder, in teams of six, rotate \naround the rest of the courts.\nBBGs usually arrive at 10am and leave as soon as possible after the last court is closed. \nThe usual routine is one hour on, one hour off. The age range of BBGs now spans 14 to 19, \nwith the older recalls covering late-night play on the Show Courts, where they have the \nrequired experience."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

The scoreboards showed the names of the players, \nthe server and the score in sets and games.\nIn 1924 when No.1 Court was brought into commission a large manually operated, \nV-shaped, double scoreboard was positioned in line with the net, high above the standing \narea on the west side of the court. By having two faces to the scoreboard all spectators \nwere able to see the score, irrespective of their seating position. The scoreboards at the sides \nof Centre Court were abandoned in 1928 and new items installed in the north-west and \nsouth-east corners of the court (same position as present). As before, these scoreboards \nshowed the names of the players, the server and the score in sets and games. However, these \nscoreboards were short-lived for, the following year, in 1929, they were replaced by two \nelectric scoreboards, designed and manufactured by Automatic Totalisator Ltd. of Ealing \nwhich, in addition to recording sets and games, showed points. Also, a third scoreboard was \nfixed above the Referee\u2019s Office, to the left of the entrance to the South-West Hall, allowing \nthose unable to gain admittance to Centre Court to follow the matches. The control board \nfor the scoreboards was a desk-like structure, positioned behind the Umpire\u2019s chair, operated \nby a man who was seated throughout the match.\nSpectators and players were so delighted with the scoreboards that the All England \nClub requested the manufacturer to install on the Centre Court not only enlarged \nscoreboards, which in addition recorded the full details of previous sets, but also to \nprovide similar scoreboards on No.1 Court, one in the north-west corner, high above the \nspectators in the open stand, and the other on the wall of Centre Court, overlooking the \ncourt. A third, to pair with the Centre Court scoreboard over the Referee\u2019s Office, was \nalso provided. By The Championships 1930, all the scoreboards were in position with \nsuitable concrete boxes for the scoreboards built to house the apparatus. The necessity to \nhave the operator on court was removed when a telephone line was connected from the \numpire to the operator and his control board suitably positioned out of sight. In 1963 the \nscoreboard in the north-west corner of No.1 Court was repositioned at ground level. In \n1979 the Centre Court and No.1 Court scoreboards were fitted with digital clocks, which \nalso indicated the length of each match.\nIn 1950, a minor limitation of the scoreboards was seen when those on No.1 Court failed \nto register beyond 19 all in the 31\u201329 second set of the gentlemen\u2019s doubles match between \nBudge Patty and Tony Trabert (USA) and Ken McGregor and Frank Sedgman (AUS).\nWhen the No.1 Court Complex was rebuilt for the Championships 1981, the \nscoreboards were replaced with electronic versions, allowing the players\u2019 names to be more \nreadily changed. With the Referee\u2019s Office demolished, the scoreboards referring to Centre \nCourt and No.1 Court, overlooking the main concourse, were replaced by electronic repeater \nscoreboards installed above the Members\u2019 balcony at the main entrance to the Clubhouse. \nThese were renewed in 2001. Another pair of repeater scoreboards were erected on the wall \nnear the Museum entrance, overlooking the Tea Lawn extension. In 1982 Centre Court was \nalso fitted with electronic scoreboards, while a third was added to the south-west corner of \nNo.1 Court for the convenience of the spectators in the north stand.\nWith the demise of the old No.1 Court in 1997, the electronic scoreboards were \nrepositioned. The older boards (first used in 1981) replaced those on the Museum walls \nand the Museum boards were relocated to the new No.1 Court. One was positioned in the \nnorthwest corner of the court, the other in the south-east corner while a new board was \ninstalled at the entrance to the South-West Hall.

In 2002, the Centre Court scoreboards were renewed.\nThese electronic scoreboards were designed for high visibility in any ambient lighting \nconditions and for ease of use. The display modules used were 5 x 7 dot matrix modules, \nutilising electromagnetic \u2018flip-dot\u2019 technology for high reliability and low power \nconsumption. The dots were coloured flat black on one side and fluorescent yellow on the \nother. To display characters a pattern of dots were \u2018flipped\u2019 over so that the character was \ndisplayed as a highly visible fluorescent yellow character on a flat black background. This \ngave maximum contrast and ensured visibility even in poor light. Each scoreboard was fitted \nwith heaters and fans to ensure that internal condensation was prevented, thus helping to \nmaintain the reliability of the electronic and display components. Total power consumption \nof each scoreboard was about 100 watts.\nIn 2006, the scoreboards were linked to the umpire\u2019s scorepad and updated automatically \nat the end of each rally. Scores from other courts were also displayed, at the change of ends. \nPrior to play, safety and information messages were displayed on the scoreboards. Player \nprofiles were shown as each match started. Back-up computers were available in each control \nroom and these were used to test the boards before play started each day. In case of a mains \npower failure a back-up supply ensured scoring would continue for at least 90 minutes.\nIn 2007, large video boards were installed on Centre and No.1 Courts to allow the player \nchallenge replays, provided by the Hawk-Eye system, to be seen by the spectators. In 2008, \nthe main scoreboards were replaced by new video boards, which displayed the scores and \nHawk-Eye replays. These boards allowed the Club to show video and selected BBC TV \noutput as appropriate.\nFrom 2009, video boards were installed on the new No.2 Court. From 2010 all three \ncourts continued to show the scoreboard, Hawk-Eye replays, BBC output and other \nvideo material as required and these facilities were extended to the new No.3 Court in \n2011. In 2013, higher resolution video blocks were introduced on all four Show Courts \nfor scoreboards and speed of serve indicators. When it rains and play continues on Centre \nCourt, the match may be shown on the screens on the other courts.\nIn 2015, the scoreboards on Courts 12 and 18 were enlarged to match those on the \nother four Show Courts, so that Hawk-Eye line call graphics could be shown. In 2018, \nall scoreboards and speed of serve boards were again replaced with the latest video block \ntechnology, improving resolution.\nIn 2021, additional scoreboards were installed in Centre and No.1 Courts in the opposite \ncorners to the main scoreboards. These scoreboards are smaller than the main scoreboards \nand will keep the score visible when Hawk-Eye replays, BBC output and other video \nmaterial is being displayed on the main scoreboards. \nAdditionally in 2021, the scoreboard layout and colour scheme were changed, \nmoving players\u2019 names to the left instead of the centre of the scoreboard. The new layout \naccommodated longer names and is consistent with the display of scores on wimbledon.com \nand other digital media. The scoreboards also incorporated the serve clock for the first time.\nOUTSIDE COURTS\nThe first scoreboards were free-standing and were located on the grass at the east side of each \ncourt in line with the net. They showed sets and games, using number plates. \nIn 1928 a scoreboard was installed on No.2 Court above the seating on the east side of the \ncourt. However, this was abandoned in 1934 when a new double-sided V-shaped scoreboard for \nuse on No.2 and No.3 Courts was mounted high at the south end of the newly built combined \nstand between the two courts. On this site in 1955 was erected a small concrete building, to \nwhich was fitted a new scoreboard for the No.2 and No.3 Courts. There was access to behind the \nscoreboard and also, via an iron spiral staircase, to a balcony overlooking No.11 Court."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Either side of the \nplayer\u2019s name were reels, containing large figures, which were revolved by hand. Sets were \nshown on the left and games on the right. In 1955 these scoreboards were renewed and \nthe opportunity was taken to modify the layout to have players\u2019 names at the top. Much \nlarger manual scoreboards were provided over the seasons 1988 and 1989. Together with \nthe modified scoreboard for No.2 and No.3 Courts, these showed points for the first time. \nWhen No.18 and No.19 Courts were brought into use in 1997, the former was provided \nwith electronic scoreboards and the latter manual scoreboards similar to other courts.\nIn 2010, Courts 14-17 trialled the use of video scoreboards. These were smaller than on \nCentre Court as they did not need to show Hawk-Eye replays. Following the success of \nthe trial, the use of electronic scoreboards was extended across the other outside courts in \n2011. In 2013, electronic scoreboards were used on all courts at the Qualifying tournament. \nIn 2018, new electronic scoreboards were used on all courts at the Qualifying tournament \nand all outside courts at The Championships. These scoreboards used the same video \nblock technology as the Show Court scoreboards. Larger scoreboards were installed on \nCourts 14-17 in 2019 to accommodate the display of Hawk-Eye player challenge graphics. \nThese scoreboards were twice the height of the other outside court scoreboards, but still \nsignificantly smaller than the show court scoreboards. These larger scoreboards were installed \non Courts 4-8 in 2021, and the new scoreboard layout and colour scheme was adopted on \nall outside court scoreboards, incorporating the serve clock.\nSCOREBOARD OPERATORS AND DATA COLLECTORS\nFrom 1994, two teams operated the scoreboards, one covering the Show Courts (Centre \nCourt and Nos. 1, 2, 3, 13 and 14 Courts) and the other the remainder of the courts. For the \nfirst time ladies were allocated to operate the electronic scoreboards on Centre Court and \nNo.1 Court. Previously three teams had been responsible, one exclusively for Centre Court \nand No.1 Court (traditionally manned by male members of the Oxford and Cambridge \nUniversity tennis teams), one for Nos. 2, 3, 13 and 14 Courts and one for the other courts.\nPrior to 1989, all the manual scoreboards (those other than Centre Court and No.1 \nCourt) were operated by the Ball Boys/Girls as part of their duties. From 1989 to 1995 a \nscoreboard operator was allocated to each of these courts to carry out that function and \nin addition to operate an \u201celectronic box\u201d which conveyed the score, point by point, to \nthe central computer. From 1996 to 1998 the data collection function on each court was \nperformed by a dedicated team of students.\nFrom 1999 the manual scoreboards were operated by the Court Attendants who were \nresponsible for the dressing of the court and the court covering under the supervision of \nthe Head Groundsman. Data collection remained the responsibility of a dedicated team of \nstudents. From 2006 the scoreboards on Centre and No.1 Courts were linked to the Chair \nUmpire\u2019s electronic scorecard which automatically updated the score. From 2009 the boards \non the new No.2 Court were updated in a similar manner, as were the scoreboards on the \nnew No.3 Court in 2011.

A Matches on Court board attached to the \nwall of No.2 Court was made available but this was removed in 2001.\nWhen Aorangi Park was commissioned in 1982, a structure in the middle of the \nGrounds displayed the order of play, the score of each match, game by game, and the final \nresult of each match. After 1985 this structure was rebuilt as the Octagon to provide public \nservices. However, in 1985 a large manually operated scoreboard was established on the \nDebentures Holders\u2019 wall facing No.15 to No.17 Courts, showing the full draw of each of \nthe five Championship events, which were updated as soon as the matches completed. An \nOrder of Play board was added in 1987.\nIn 1994 an electronic scoreboard was installed overlooking the southern concourse, \nopposite the Members\u2019 Enclosure (now Centenary Garden), which displayed in turn current \nscores of matches on court.\nIn 1997 two similar electronic scoreboards were installed at the entrance to the North- \nEast and South-East Halls of the new No.1 Court Stadium and in 2001 a further electronic \nscoreboard was installed on the north wall of the Press Centre.\nIn 1997 a large manually operated scoreboard was installed in the new Championship \nEntrance area, showing the full draw of each of the five Championship events, which were \nupdated as soon as the matches were completed, and the order of play for all courts.\nA Match Information Display was positioned on the north wall of No.2 Court in 2001 \nand 2002 but moved to the south-west wall of Centre Court in 2003. This electronic display \nshowed the latest point by point scores for the matches on all 18 courts. Before play started, \nthe full order of play was shown.\nIn 2003 an Electronic Match board, displaying point by point information, using flip dot \ntechnology, was installed between the southern ends of Courts 11 and 13.\nIn 2007, both the Match Information and Electronic Match Boards were replaced by full \ncolour video boards showing the same information.\nIn 2008 there was no room to locate the board in the southern part of the Grounds \nso this was positioned above the bandstand on the Tea Lawn. From 2009, the Match \nInformation Boards were repositioned on the northern wall of the Cafe Pergola (now \nCentenary Garden), facing the Tea Lawn and at the south-west corner of Centre Court. \nThey showed the order of play, point by point scores and player profiles, depending on the \ntime of day.\n* The Championships 2020 \nwas not held due to the \nCovid-19 pandemic."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

At the Dinner, which is \nhosted by the Committee of Management, the gathering of many international players and \nofficials and others prominent in the game toasts the newly crowned singles champions. The \nChampions\u2019 Dinner in 1986 commemorated the 100th Championships. \nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic, the dinner was not held in 2020 and 2021. In 2022 and \n2023 it was held in The Lawn, a Championships hospitality venue on the grounds of The \nWimbledon Club, across the road from the AEL TC main site. In 2024 the Champions\u2019 \nDinner returned to Central London, being held at Raffles London at the Old War Office, in \nWhitehall. It will be held there again in 2025.\nIn 1977 the L TA Ball moved to the first Saturday in order to stage The Championships \nCentenary Ball, which was held at the Hilton Hotel. The function has remained fixed to \nthat evening ever since, initially taking place at the Hilton Hotel, before being held at the \nGrosvenor House, 1987\u20132003, the Lancaster Gate Hotel, 2004\u20132005, the Hurlingham \nClub, 2006\u20132012, the Boiler House, Battersea Power Station, 2013 and the Hurlingham \nClub from 2014 to 2024, excluding 2020 and 2021 when it was not held. Between 2016 and \n2018 it was known as the British Tennis Ball. \nThe history of the L TA Ball stretches back to 1935, at the Dorchester Hotel. This \nfunction superseded the annual Banquet or Dinner held for many years at the close of The \nChampionships, at various hotels, including the Savoy and Piccadilly. The L TA felt that the \nnew venture was in keeping with changing times and that guests preferred an evening of \ndancing (with supper) rather than the formal dignity of a banquet. The following year the \nvenue was changed to the Grosvenor House and this was maintained up to 1976 (during the \nausterity years, 1946\u20131950, the functions were styled Buffet Dances).\nAbove: Singles Champions Carlos Alcaraz and Barbora Krejcikova share a dance on stage at the \nChampions\u2019 Dinner just a few hours after the conclusion of The Championships 2024"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Arriving by car at around 3.15p.m., they were met by the Committee at the \nentrance to the Ground and escorted to the Committee Box, which had temporarily been \nfitted out as a Royal Box. They stayed until a thunderstorm put an end to the day\u2019s play, \nhaving watched the last of Wilberforce Eaves v Leonard Escombe, May Sutton v Agatha \nMorton and part of a doubles contest. Before leaving the Ground, the Prince accepted \nan offer of the Presidency of the Club and declared his intention to donate to the Club \na challenge trophy. The Prince remained President until his accession to the throne as \nKing George V in 1910. He then became Patron of the Club, a position subsequently \nmaintained by succeeding monarchs. \nQueen Elizabeth II served as Patron from 1952 until the end of 2016, when she stood \ndown and was succeeded by the Duchess of Cambridge (now Princess of Wales). King \nGeorge V and Queen Mary were avid spectators at The Championships, being present each \nyear from 1919 to 1934, with the exception of 1927 and 1929. Queen Mary continued this \nassociation and from 1935 to 1951 missed only the meeting of 1936. \nWhen in 1922 King George V, accompanied by Queen Mary, opened the Church Road \nground, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII and Duke of Windsor) and Prince \nAlbert (later Duke of York and King George VI) were present. In 1926, on the occasion \nof The Jubilee Championships, the latter competed in the Gentlemen\u2019s Doubles event in \npartnership with L. Greig (later Sir Louis Greig, Chairman of The All England Lawn \nTennis Club), but they were well beaten in the first round by Roper Barrett and Arthur \nGore. In 1947 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were present to watch the gentlemen\u2019s \nsingles final.\nQueen Elizabeth II visited The Championships on Saturday 6 July 1957, Friday 6 July \n1962 and, during her Silver Jubilee year, on Friday 1 July 1977, also the occasion of The \nChampionship\u2019s Centenary. Her Majesty\u2019s final visit was on Thursday 24 June 2010. Prince \nPhilip, Duke of Edinburgh, attended in 1949, 1953, 1954, 1957, 1960 and 1977. \nKing Charles III (as Prince of Wales) was present in 1960, 1970 and 2012. Queen Camilla \n(as Duchess of Cornwall) has been a regular visitor to The Championships, including with \nher husband in 2012.\nIn 1929, Prince George became President of the Club and so began the long association \nwith the Kent family. When he died in 1942 his widow, the Duchess of Kent (later Princess \nMarina) succeeded in the post and, up to her death in 1968, attended 23 successive years, \nmany of them most days. The tradition continued with the present Duke of Kent, who \nsucceeded his mother in 1969. He attended frequently each year and presented the trophies \nuntil his retirement after The Championships 2021. \nThe very first Royal visits to The Championships were by Austrian Royalty. Prince \nBatthyany Strattman, husband of Crown Princess Stephanie, attended on several days of The \nChampionships 1895. The Prince and Crown Princess together attended the Gentlemen\u2019s \nDoubles Challenge round on Monday 15 July.\nThe first Royal competitor at The Championships is believed to be Prince Friedrich Karl \nof Prussia, a nephew of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. Playing under the name \u2018F. Karl\u2019, he \nlost in the first round to Reginald Gamble of Great Britian."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Among the major innovations, at \nthe time, was enabling Wimbledon fans to receive match results for their favourite players \nand news during The Championships. In 2009, a new wimbledon.org site provided an \noptimised experience for fans browsing the internet from their mobile phone.

For The Championships 2016, Wimbledon \nlaunched new, responsive apps for iOS, Android and Apple TV, including a bespoke \nexperience for the visitor, and made further improvements to the website, video and social \ncontent offering.\nBy 2018, Wimbledon\u2019s social media audience had grown to more than 10 million, while \nthe digital audience during The Championships reached 21 million. In 2019, developments \nincluded the launch of myWIMBLEDON, a guest communications platform, new statistics \nofferings, a video-first content approach, and an expansion of the Wimbledon Archive, now \nincluding key statistics from the Wimbledon Compendium. The Wimbledon Apps were further \nexpanded with the use of Augmented Reality technology, and social media continued to play \na crucial role, with Wimbledon present across all major platforms: Facebook, Twitter (now \nknown as X), Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, Pinterest, Weibo, Wechat, TikTok and Giphy.\nFor 2020, the AEL TC was set to host the Wimbledon Public Ballot online for the first \ntime, with prospective applicants asked to register for the Ballot via myWIMBLEDON. \nHowever, the cancellation of The Championships saw wimbledon.com fill the Fortnight period \nby providing an interactive, day-by-day retelling of the greatest matches in the event\u2019s history. \nIn 2022, mobile ticketing was enhanced across wimbledon.com and the apps, , and new \nmatch insights providing fans with the likelihood of the outcome. Wimbledon also became \nthe first tennis event to launch an experience in Roblox, along with the Wimbledon Kids \nseries for YouTube, to attract the younger generation of fans.\n2023 saw Wimbledon enter Fortnite with the Race to Wimbledon mini game. The \nutilisation of Artificial Intelligence across Wimbledon\u2019s digital platforms continued, in the \nform of AI commentary on highlights packages and AI analysis of the Championships \nDraws. Further AI enhancements in 2024 included the use of Generative AI to produce \nmatch previews and reviews for every singles match. In addition, in 2024 the AEL TC held \nits first-ever esports tournament, alongside being featured in the video game TopSpin 2k25.\nDuring The Championships 2024, Wimbledon saw record levels of online engagement, \nincluding 3 billion impressions and 115 million engagements on social media.\nINFORMATION SERVICE\nThe Official Information Technology Supplier, IBM, develops and provides IT services for \nthe All England Club and The Championships. Designed to offer a comprehensive source of \ndata on every aspect of The Championships, the multimedia Wimbledon Interactive service \n(WIS), a web browser-based Intranet, provides access to live scores and statistics, order of \nplay and results, player biographies with Grand Slam and Tour results as well as other tour \ninformation. WIS is updated in real time and is used to provide up-to-date and accurate \ninformation to broadcasters and the press. WIS is also available to players, public and officials. \nThe information is collected from a variety of IT systems and databases. One of the most \nimportant is the court-side statistics entry system, operated on all courts by tennis experts \nusing a laptop computer, which records details of each point scored during the tournament. \nAs well as being used for WIS, this data is used to produce the score and statistical TV \ngraphics for the Wimbledon Broadcast Services which are seen on the BBC and around the \nworld, and also to update live scores on the website and apps. \nAs well as up-to-date information on the current Championships, WIS gives access to \ncomprehensive statistical information on The Championships since 1992 and historical results \ndating back to the first Championships in 1877.\nPROGRAMMES\nThe programme at the first Championship in 1877 was printed on thin card, folded into two, to \ngive a page size of 6 x 4 inches.

The programme was kept up to date, with the name of the winner of each \nmatch being printed overnight, a practice which has continued to the present time.\nThe programme had a similar appearance until the early 1890s, when very thin cards, 4 x \n3 inches, were provided. Printed on both sides were the draws of one, two or three events. \nThese cards, easy to slip into the pocket, cost threepence and gave much information, such \nas a plan of the Grounds, a timetable for trains between Wimbledon and Waterloo, a list of \nthe Committee of Management members, times of play and the match scores.\nAs the number of events and competitors increased the programme was enlarged \naccordingly. From 1899 to 1904 the card was folded into two, to give a page size of 8 x 5 \ninches. The court layout and times of play were not detailed and from 1902 the train times \nwere deleted. The more commercial aspects of the production were apparent when the \nfirst advertisement was shown in 1903, offering a book for sale. From 1905 the card was \nfolded into three and by 1914 the page size had risen to 13 x 5 inches. The 1909 edition re-\nintroduced the layout of the courts and the day\u2019s schedule of matches.\nAfter the First World War in 1919, the programme was expanded again to consist of eight \npages of paper, 12.5 x 10 inches, folded into two. The manner of presentation of the draws and \nother information laid the foundation of the present day programme. In 1924 the programme \nwas produced in a stapled book form to include a cover. The size of this page remained around \n12 x 10 inches and for the first time a list of previous winners of the events was included. \nDuring the Twenties and Thirties the programme remained substantially unchanged. \nThere was a rotation of colour used for the front cover board and as the advertisements grew \nso did the number of pages. The 1946 programme had a touch of austerity but a year later \nthe first photographs appeared with an aerial view of the Centre Court on the front cover, \nwhich was printed green throughout the fortnight, with a page inside showing various \npictures from the previous year\u2019s Championships. In 1948 the front cover was printed in \na different colour each day of the week and these were repeated during the second week. \nA photograph of a player appeared daily as an integral part of the front cover. Inside each \nday was a different article written by Brigadier J.G. Smyth, V.C., M.C., together with \na selection of photographic illustrations. Also evident for the first time were full page \nfour-colour advertisements. In 1949 an alphabetical 'List of Competitors' was given. For \nthe next 20 years or so the programme\u2019s format changed little, although occasionally in \nthe late Fifties and Sixties a colour photograph appeared on the front cover of the final \nprogramme. New ground was broken in 1977 when the Centenary programme provided \nplayer biographies, accompanied by colour photographs. Since that date the programme \nhas expanded to provide more information. In 1985 the Qualifying singles results and the \nprevious year\u2019s Championship singles draws were included for the first time.  \nIn 2002, there was a break with tradition when for the first time the competitors\u2019 \nforenames, instead of initials, were shown in the opening round of the gentlemen\u2019s and \nladies\u2019 singles events. Thereafter, in these two draws, initials were retained, together with \nthe ladies\u2019 titles, Mrs. or Miss. However, in 2009 all five Championship draws showed \nforenames throughout, while the ladies\u2019 titles were dropped.\nFrom 2010 the pages of the Programme were perfect bound and in 2015 advertising in \nthe Programme was limited to official suppliers only.\nPRICE OF PROGRAMMES\n1877 \u2013 c 1889  6d. \nc1890 \u2013 1898  3d.(per card)\n1899 \u2013 1914  6d. \n1919 \u2013 1939   \n1946 \u2013 1947 } 1s.0d. \n1948 \u2013 1951  2s.0d.

The film \nstarred Dean Paul Martin, Ali McGraw and the \u2018real-life\u2019 Argentinian star Guillermo Vilas. \nThe action was filmed just before the ladies\u2019 singles final on the second Friday and featured \nimpressive shots of the grounds from the air as well as convincing court action, with Dan \nMaskell in the commentary box.\nThe following year Centre Court was once again seen in widescreen when part of the \ncomedy heist movie, Rough Cut, starring Burt Reynolds, Lesley-Ann Down and David \nNiven was filmed there in July, with over 600 extras employed. Connors and Borg are shown \nin action, along with some shots outside the stadium and in the crowd. \nTwenty-five years would pass before cinephiles caught another glimpse of the hallowed \nlawns, when the Club teamed up with Working Title films and the Grounds played its own \nsignificant role in the romantic comedy Wimbledon. The film starred Kirsten Dunst and \nPaul Bettany, with scenes being filmed during The Championships, and throughout July \nand August, all over the Grounds and on Centre Court. The film told the fictional story of \nPeter Colt, a former star English player in the twilight of his career, who is having a last tilt \nat Wimbledon. As Serena Williams drily observed at the time, \u201cIt must be a comedy if a \nBritish player is winning at Wimbledon.\u201d\nWhilst not actually filmed in SW19, the 2016 film Borg vs McEnroe, starring Sverrir \nGudnason as Borg and Shia LaBeouf as McEnroe, depicted the 1981 gentlemen\u2019s singles \nfinal between the two on Centre Court, whilst actually using the Stvanice tennis arena in \nPrague. The bonus features section of the DVD includes Gudnason\u2019s filmed visit to Centre \nCourt and a tour around the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum.\nIn 2021, Warner Bros released a film, King Richard, which stars Will Smith as the \neponymous Richard Williams and depicts the early life of Venus and Serena Williams.  \nThe Club hosted the media launch for the film in the UK.\nMEDIA\n \nAround 550 writers and international radio reporters attend The Championships, drawn \nfrom over 50 countries. Of these, approximately 105 have full, automatic access to the \nCentre Court media seating and a further 80 or so have automatic access for the first 10 \ndays. The remainder have a full Championships or individual day Rover pass which gives \nthem access to Centre and No.1 Courts when there is space available, and to use the \nreserved media seating on the remaining Show Courts. All media can access a variety of \nfacilities, including the 24-hour Media Restaurant situated under Court 14.\nOn any given day, the average number of press attending is 450 to 500. The British press \ncorps totals approximately 250 but the figure is dependent on other major sporting events \ntaking place at the same time as The Championships (often FIFA World Cup or European \nChampionships football).\nNational newspapers and press agencies may have up to 12 journalists attending \u2013 \nsport, features and news \u2013 and journalists from regional publications attend, particularly if \nfollowing a British player who is local to them.\nIn 2024, the country with the next largest representation was Italy, with 33 \ncorrespondents, followed by the United States, Spain, Germany, France, Japan and Poland, \nall with between 11-27 representatives amongst the written press. The number of press \nattending The Championships from overseas is often reflected by the number of players \nfrom that particular country competing, so will fluctuate year to year.\nIn 2000 the press and photographers were provided with purpose-built facilities in the \nMillennium Building.

Photographers were relocated to a new, state-of-the-art facility under Court 14 in \n2015 and the press joined broadcasters in a new and improved Media Restaurant.\nIn 2023 the media interview facilities moved from their traditional home in the \nMillennium Building to a purpose-built space on top of the Broadcast Centre called the \nMedia Pavilion. The Media Pavilion features a new Media Theatre, containing state-of-the-\nart technology, and a further seven interview rooms, an outdoor broadcast mixed zone, and \ntwo levels of bookable stand-up and presentation positions for rights-holders. Interviews \ntaking place in the Media Theatre and Interview Room 2 are relayed live to the writing \nrooms and followed by transcripts for those who are unable to attend the interview in person \n\u2013 a facility which is particularly helpful when deadlines are approaching.\nThere are three main press writing rooms, one on each floor, with enough desks for 360 \njournalists. Each desk is fully equipped with an interactive screen incorporating 33 channels \nas well as all Championships information and latest results from each court as they become \navailable. IBM provides statistical information and a dedicated team can generate specific \nstatistics if requested.  Those members of the press who do not have a desk assigned to \nthem are able to follow the event in a TV monitor room close to the writing rooms or use \na hot desk. The press and photographers are looked after by a Media team employed by the \nAEL TC specifically for that purpose. Work on accreditation and administration of the press \nand photography facilities begins in January each year. Support for the player interview and \nmatch information functions during The Championships is provided by staff from the L TA, \nATP and WTA Tours, and the ITF.\nTELEVISION\nPlay was televised for the first time in 1937, when matches were transmitted by the BBC \nfrom Centre Court for up to half an hour each day of The Championships. Two cameras \nwere used, one at the south-east corner of the court, giving close-up views and the other in a \nfixed position at the other end of the court, providing a general view of the scene.\nThe cameras were connected by cable to a unit in the car park which transmitted by radio \nto Alexandra Palace. On the opening day, viewers saw 25 minutes of the match between \nBunny Austin and George Lyttleton Rogers. The commentator was F.H. Grisewood, who \nduring the Fortnight was assisted by Capt. H.B.T . Wakelam and Col. R.H. Brand. Soon \nafter The Championships, the BBC returned to Wimbledon to televise the Davis Cup Inter-\nZone Final and Challenge Round, again for a short period each day.\nIn 1938 and 1939, a third camera was added to television coverage of The \nChampionships. After the Second World War in 1946, television covered the annual \nWightman Cup tie in mid-June and then The Championships, but not before the first \nSaturday. An interview took place for the first time on the final Saturday, when the new \nchampions, Yvon Petra and Pauline Betz, were interviewed by Alice Marble, the 1939 \nchampion. Eurovision first covered The Championships in 1954 and in 1956 Independent \nTelevision started to compete with the BBC. However, it withdrew after 1968, realising that \ndouble coverage was not commercially viable.\nThe very first colour television transmission in the UK took place on the first Saturday \nin 1967 when BBC2 showed a four-and-a-half-hour programme from Centre Court, \ncommencing at 2pm. The first match was Cliff Drysdale (RSA) versus Roger Taylor \n(GBR). Transmissions in colour were also made each afternoon of the following week, \nplus a 30-minute highlights programme each evening. In August that year a professional \ntournament, produced by the BBC to mark the introduction of colour television, was held \non Centre Court. The pattern was set for all future Championships.\n2017 marked 90 years of BBC Radio and 80 years for BBC TV at The Championships. \nIn 2018 the AEL TC took control of the host coverage under \u2018Wimbledon Broadcast \nServices\u2019 (WBS) but a new rights agreement guaranteed that the relationship with the BBC "}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

This audience continues to grow because of the All England \nClub\u2019s agreements with a wide range of media partners, transmitted to over 200 countries.\nIn the United Kingdom the BBC transmits over 150 hours of coverage across BBC1 and \nBBC2 including a daily highlights programme in the evening, and many more hours on \ntheir iPlayer service, and online.\nOwing to the various time differences around the world, it is inevitable that somewhere, \na Wimbledon programme, either live or recorded, is being broadcast every moment \nthroughout the Fortnight.

For the first time, there was multicamera \ncoverage from all 18 courts, produced now by over 120 host cameras across the site. A \ncombination of manned and robotic camera solutions is utilised, with the number of \ncameras ranging from five on some outside courts to 29 on Centre Court. Each individual \ncourt feed features dedicated replay and graphics facilities, a director with full audio and \nvisual support, as well as world feed commentary from up to 11 courts at any one time. 2019 \nsaw WBS introduce a 600m point-to-point wire-camera on the former Wimbledon Park \ngolf course which gave stunning pictures of the Grounds, affording viewers a unique, not \npreviously seen, perspective of the site.\nAt The Championships 2022, for the first time, every match during the Fortnight was \ntelevised, and for 2023 UHD/HDR coverage was extended from Centre Court to include \nNo.1 Court; The Championships 2025 will see all live feeds available in a minimum picture \nquality of 1080pHDR. WBS produces a unique look behind-the-scenes on the \u2018Access All \nEngland\u2019 channel that covers players from the moment they arrive on site via 15 cameras \nacross Aorangi and the Millennium Building, following their pre-match preparations. \nWIMBLEDON RADIO CHANNEL\nIn 1992, a special station known as \u2018Radio Wimbledon\u2019 began broadcasting, providing \nvisitors and the local community with up to 14 hours of live programming each day during \nThe Championships. The service included match reports and results, local information on \nweather, travel and traffic, the daily order of play, features on players, information for visitors \nabout facilities in the Grounds and interviews with players. \nNow called The Wimbledon Radio Channel, the service is available worldwide on \nwimbledon.com and the Official Wimbledon Apps, and for the local community within a \nradius of four miles of the Club Grounds, on three FM services. The main service is on \n87.7FM while ball-by-ball commentary of the matches on Centre and No.1 Courts is \navailable on 96.3FM and 97.8FM respectively, to enable spectators with a visual or hearing \ndisability to follow play more easily.

The later \nposters were colourful and contained much information, such as directions and ticket prices. \nIn the early 1980s the All England Lawn Tennis Club undertook the design of the posters \nwith London Transport arranging the distribution.\nHowever, in 1995, use of the poster on the London Underground was discontinued as \nthe advent of websites and local radio providing relevant information dispensed with the \nneed for this form of advertising. \nAs the posters had become very popular with the public, the Club decided to produce \nannually, for sale, a similar poster, but with reduced information. Since 1986, a poster has \nbeen on sale to the public in the Wimbledon Shops. \nThe Official Poster for The Championships 2025 is titled \u2018Tennis in an English Garden\u2019, \ncreated by British graphic designer Sarah Madden, and appears in full colour on the back \ncover of this book, as well as in black and white on page 20. Inspired by the unique floral \nsurroundings of The Championships, the artwork captures the contrast between world-class \ntennis and the serene, botanical beauty of SW19. An excited crowd blends seamlessly into a \npristine flowerbed of hydrangeas, petunias, butterflies and bees \u2013 highlighting Wimbledon\u2019s \ndistinctive blend of sport and nature.\nMadden commented: \u201cWimbledon is more than a tennis tournament \u2013 it\u2019s a celebration \nof tradition, the English summer in full bloom, and a sporting experience unlike others. The \natmosphere strikes a beautiful balance between the excitement of the crowd, the beauty of \nthe setting, and the timeless prestige of The Championships. I wanted the poster to capture \nthat balance and unmistakably convey the essence of Wimbledon, showcasing the intensity \nof the sport, the thrill of the crowds, and the calm, natural beauty of its surroundings. \nWimbledon has a magic of its own, and I hope this artwork reflects that.\u201d\n "}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

The decision as to why dark green and \npurple were chosen is not stated in the Club\u2019s records, although several theories have been \nput forward. One is that the choice was based on a line from the poem Milton by William \nBlake, which references \u201cWimbledon\u2019s green and impurpled Hills\u201d. Another is that the \ncolours are based on those of the suffragettes. However, there is no evidence for or against \neither of these theories.\nGROUNDS\n \nThe Club Grounds consist of 18 grass courts (including Centre Court and No.1 Court), four \nAmerican clay courts and four acrylic courts. In Aorangi Park & Southlands, there are 20 \ngrass courts for practice before and during The Championships.

A new underground car park has space \nfor circa 330 vehicles (including electric charging points, motorcycle and bike parking). In \naddition, there is a tunnel link to the Millennium Building under Somerset Road.\nThe building was designed by Hopkins Architects and has a dual purpose. Year round \nit provides Members with both indoor and outdoor tennis facilities, while during The \nChampionships it facilitates the players\u2019 drop off and accreditation, as well as transport/\ncourtesy car operations.\nThe project was designed to be the most sustainable building in the AEL TC portfolio \nand includes heat pumps, PV cells on the roof, as well as a naturally ventilated tennis hall. \nThe new facility also acts as an Energy Centre, which serves the wider estate, and includes \nthe provision of cooling for Centre Court when the roof is closed.\n "}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Late that year the \nWorple Road ground was secured and formally opened in 1870 with the staging of the \nsecond Championships.\nIn 1875 lawn tennis was first played at the Club and when in 1877 the inaugural Lawn \nTennis Championship was held the title of the Club was amended to the \u2018All England \nCroquet and Lawn Tennis Club\u2019. Gradually interest in croquet declined and by the end of \n1882 participation had ceased and \u2018Croquet\u2019 was removed from the Club\u2019s title.\nDuring 1896 the croquet players were invited to return. In 1899 the Club \nChampionship was reinstated and \u2018Croquet\u2019 was restored to the Club\u2019s title. However, the \nupsurge in interest did not last long and after the 1904 Championship the game faded \nagain, but the Club retained the title of \u2018All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club\u2019.\nCroquet was not provided for when the Club moved to the present Church Road \nground, and was first played on 7 September 1953 when exhibition matches were staged \nby the Croquet Association to mark the Coronation Year.\nFrom 1 June 1957 to 2 September 2007 the croquet lawn was situated at the \nsouthern end of the grounds, alongside the Church Road boundary fence. This was not \nfull size and competitive play was restricted to Club tournaments. The Club Croquet \nChampionship was reintroduced together with a handicap singles event in 1960 and \nin recent years a golf croquet event was started. In the autumn of 2007 the Club\u2019s \nLong Term Plan necessitated other use for the area and new lawns were created in the \nSouthlands College ground which was opened on 19 April 2008 by Professor Bernard \nNeal, President of the Croquet Association. \nThe Captain of the Croquet section is Julie Willson.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWIMBLEDON LAWN TENNIS MUSEUM\n \nWimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum was opened by H.R.H. The Duke of Kent on 19 May \n1977 as part of the Centenary celebrations. The construction of the Centre Court East \nSide Building in 1984/85 led to the design of a completely new Museum, in which more \nof the expanding collection could be seen.\nIn 1993 H.R.H. The Duke of Kent consented to become Patron and during 1994 \nvisited the Museum. The announcement in 2002 of the Club\u2019s plans for a roof on Centre \nCourt and the redevelopment of the East Side necessitated the removal of the Museum \nand all its associated activities. The old Museum closed in October 2005 and a new \nMuseum, housed in the new Museum Building, was opened on 12 April 2006 by H.R.H. \nThe Duke of Kent.\n1960\u20131962 H.G. Stoker\n1963 B.G.

This exhibition delves into the sport\u2019s rich history, from the spread of tennis \nacross the British Empire, before becoming a chic activity on the French Riviera during \nthe roaring Twenties, and its rise to global prominence through international tournaments. \nFeaturing star objects such as Sir Andy Murray\u2019s 2012 Olympic gold medal and Emma \nRaducanu\u2019s 2021 US Open Trophy, Grassroots to Global Game offers an engaging and \ninteractive journey through tennis\u2019 transformation into the international phenomenon it \nis today.

WJTI, as it has become \nknown over the years, is the Club\u2019s flagship tennis programme, introducing tennis to new \nplayers around Merton and Wandsworth as well as developing young players to be the \nbest player that they can be.\nWJTI was the brainchild of Dan Bloxham, who set up the initiative with the support \nof AEL TC Committee member Julian Tatum. Bloxham subsequently joined the AEL TC \non a full-time basis as the Club\u2019s Head Coach and continued to run the WJTI until 2023. \nThe initiative is now overseen by the AEL TC\u2019s Community head coach, Chris Daw.\nThe first weekend of coaching at the AEL TC Grounds attracted more than 700 \nchildren and the programme has gone from strength to strength ever since. In 2005 the \nWJTI squad performed a demonstration of their abilities before the start of play on \nCourt 14 on the final day of The Championships. This became an annual tradition, with \nfamous names taking part including Roger Federer, the Williams sisters, John McEnroe \nand Martina Hingis, as well as Tim Henman and other leading British players. In 2010, \nQueen Elizabeth II attended the session, as part of her final visit to The Championships, \nan event which subsequently featured in that year\u2019s Queen\u2019s Christmas Broadcast.\nSince 2001, WJTI coaches have made over 2,000 visits to state schools in Merton and \nWandsworth. These visits have offered over 250,000 children a constructive experience of \ntennis, and the teachers have received many lessons and ideas which they can replicate. \nThis year the WJTI visits schools with the highest pupil premium six consecutive times to \nensure tennis is reaching children who have never played before and do not currently have \naccess to the sport. In the third school term, coaches also visit a different school weekly, \nallowing more students across Merton and Wandsworth to experience tennis.\nUp to four children from each school visit can be selected to join the WJTI and attend \nthe weekend coaching sessions which are now held at the AEL TC Community Tennis \nCentre in Raynes Park. Over 2,000 children have joined the WJTI in the last two decades \nand received free coaching throughout their junior career. \nAround 320 children play tennis with WJTI every weekend at the Community Tennis \nCentre. As part of the WJTI, children also learn about the Club, the Members, players, \nThe Championships and the types of careers that it is possible to explore within tennis.\nWJTI players and parents also enjoy an array of events and opportunities at the Club, \nsuch as tours, tournaments, and community days. Before The Championships, our newly \nselected players are welcomed to the Club to receive a tour from the Learning Team and \nsee their favourite players practice before the main event.\nSince its introduction, WJTI has transformed the lives of many children, giving them \nthe confidence to succeed in tennis and life in general. Several have even qualified as \ntennis coaches and thus have been able to pass on their experience to the next generations \nof participants.

Criteria for the Award are: (i) a major and \nexceptional contribution to the organisation, conduct, advancement or quality of The \nChampionships (ii) which have been sustained over a long period (generally not less \nthan 10 years) and (iii) which has upheld the highest standards of excellence and care \nassociated with Wimbledon. Service may be in a voluntary capacity or as a paid employee \nor consultant and may be full-time or part-time. A member of the Club may be eligible \nas a candidate although service as a member of the Club Committee or the Committee of \nManagement, or as a player, is not relevant for this purpose. The Committee may amend \nthese criteria or take into account such other factors as the Committee thinks fit. The \nCommittee\u2019s decision is final.\nIt will be rare, over time, for the Award to be made to more than one person in any \nparticular year. This is an honour for truly exceptional service and there may be years \nwhen no award is given. An Award will generally not be made until after the individual\u2019s \nretirement or ceasing to occupy the relevant position of service.\nThe Award comprises of a prize suitably engraved and presented on an occasion during The \nChampionships. Also, certain privileges will be granted to each holder during the tournament.\nHOLDERS OF THE AWARD"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

It follows \nthat each court area has its own personality, its own atmosphere and its own aura. Whilst the \ngroundstaff pride themselves on the uniformity and the consistency of the playing surfaces, \nwhat lies beneath the actual ground may also differ drastically from what we see, with different \nhistories, bedrocks and even drying times. The incredible achievement is to get each of them \nplaying at both their own peak and exactly the same as the other courts \u2013 for one month-long \nwindow at the end of June and the start of July each year. Head of Courts and Horticulture, \nNeil Stubley, explains that this goal of consistency, spanning all the way from a northern practice \ncourt to Centre Court and beyond \u2013 across a 42-acre site with numerous microclimates and \ninfluences \u2013 takes some doing. This is a brief history of how a set of grass rectangles, a net and \nsome chalk make up the very history of The Championships at Wimbledon.\n}Notes: * The Championships 2020 was not held due \nto the Covid-19 pandemic. \u2020 Capacity fluctuated \ndue to changes in Covid-19 restrictions.\n42,000\n42,000\n}"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

The on-court drama \nand controversy is largely \ncovered in the Year-by-Year \nsection, and the \u2018invasions\u2019 \nin another, but here we take \na brief look back at those \nmoments when the action \nwas not just of the sporting \nvariety.\n\u2022 Designed by Captain \nStanley Peach, the court \nopened in 1922 as the brand-\nnew main \u2018Show Court\u2019 for the Grounds. At the Nursery Lane site the \u2018Centre Court\u2019 had \nbeen so named as it sat in the centre of nine surrounding courts, but here it was at the \nnorthern end of the Grounds\u2019 layout. Despite the fact that it should probably have been \ncalled \u2018North Central Court\u2019 it happily retained its name and would one day reclaim its \ncentral position.\n\u2022 The first man to play on Centre Court wearing shorts was seen in 1933 when Britain\u2019s \nBunny Austin took on Keith Gledhill in front of the Queen.\n\u2022 Centre Court was struck by a 500-pound bomb in October 1940, with the Grounds also \nbeing hit by a further four.

This \u2018octuple\u2019 of courts is almost 100 \nyears old and serves as a veritable model of stability to the modern arenas that have been \nlaid around them. Neil Stubley explains that these are essentially the original courts, from \nthe first Championships on this site in 1922. They were built from a base of ash, from the \nspent energy of coal mines, rather than the concrete base we see now. These older courts \nare stable and more predictable in their behaviour, unlike the newer courts, which can be \nharder to forecast. Their history reflects that of The Championships themselves, dating back \nto the original move from Nursery Lane.\n\u2022 Court 4, to the south-west of Centre, was the only one of the eight which was built as \na \u2018pallet court\u2019, created in one-metre square frames off-site, where they are matured and \nbrought up to speed with the rest of the playing surfaces. The new Court 7 used to be \nCourt 5 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re calling it The Rocket Launcher, in recognition of it launching \nthe career of one of the sport\u2019s most popular and enduring figures. To have won the fabled \nGrand Slam in singles once is an achievement \u2013 only three women and two men have done \nit \u2013 but to do it twice puts you at the very top of the tree. This is what was achieved by the \nAustralian Rod \u2018Rocket\u2019 Laver in 1962 and again in 1969. It was here in the reasonably \nunheralded surroundings of Court 5 that a 17-year-old Laver first strode out on to \nWimbledon\u2019s lawns in 1956, as he was defeated by the Italian Orlando Sirola. It would  \nbe a further five years (and two lost finals) before Laver finally lifted the trophy. \n\u2022 The number 6 is seen to represent a completeness and it fits that Court 6\u2019s positioning \nto the south of Centre Court, as originally laid out in 1922, has remained the same ever \nsince: third in the line of four that stretches west to east in front of the Clubhouse facade. \nIn 1957 Brazil\u2019s Maria de Amorim was beaten here by the Dutch player Berna Thung in \nthe second round\u00a0of the ladies\u2019 singles.

American Jeff Tarango, who had been \nplaying in the doubles match in which Tim Henman had been defaulted four days previously, \nwas playing a third round singles tie against Alexander Mronz and he was none too happy \nwith the umpire, nor the crowd. After telling the vociferous fans his innermost thoughts \nhe then excoriated the umpire Bruno Rebeuh after numerous overrules against him and he \nfinally stormed off court, stating, \u201cI\u2019m not playing anymore!\u201d, thereby forfeiting the match. \nThe unlucky court was replaced in 2007 by the new No.2 Court and has not been seen since.\n \nCOURT 14: THE NORTHERN QUARTER\n \n\u2022 1980 saw a sizable change at Wimbledon as four new courts were brought into action \nto the north of Centre Court. They were numbered 14 to 17 and effectively returned the \nCentre Court to, if not the centre, certainly the most central position it had enjoyed since \nthe move from Nursery Lane in 1922.\n\u2022 The court had its own part in the incredible Boris Becker story of 1985 when it hosted the \ndramatic fourth round clash between the young German star and No.16 seed \u2018Gentleman \nTim\u2019 Mayotte. The athletic, almost gymnastic Becker had been forced to retire the year \nbefore and the crowd held their breath when he took a mighty fall in the fourth set. He \nthankfully recovered and the rest, as they say, is history. \n\u2022 In 1995, the year of the repeated default, Tim Henman became the first player to be \ndisqualified from Wimbledon when playing in a doubles match with Jeremy Bates against \nAmerica\u2019s Jeff Tarango and Sweden\u2019s Henrik Holm. Leading two sets to one, Henman \nwhacked a ball in anger, accidentally hitting 16-year-old Ball Girl Caroline Hall in the \nhead. The Championships Referee Alan Mills was called and Henman became the first-ever \nplayer to be defaulted out of Wimbledon.\n\u2022 An early demonstration of wheelchair tennis was given on Court 14 by four of Britain\u2019s \nleading players in 2001. This was followed by the first Wheelchair Gentlemen\u2019s Doubles \nevent, for four pairs, held on Courts 14 and 15 over the last Saturday and Sunday in 2005.\n\u2022 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II immediately became the arena\u2019s most famed spectator \nwhen she watched a junior tennis showcase here in 2010. \n\u2022 If the introduction of final set tie-breaks was intended to bring an end to excessively long \nmatches, it didn\u2019t entirely work in the case of the 2023 ladies\u2019 singles third round match \nbetween Lesia Tsurenko and Ana Bogdan. It was won by the latter, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (20-18) \nin three hours and 40 minutes, making it the fourth longest ladies\u2019 match in Wimbledon \nhistory and just five minutes short of the longest.

Around 5,200 square metres of fabric was used. A key element of the \ndesign allows natural light to reach the grass \u2013 brought about by re-contouring the fixed roof.\nAn airflow system removes condensation from within the bowl to provide good court \nsurface conditions conducive to the playing of tennis when the roof is closed.\nThe roof is divided into two sections, with a total of nine bays of tensioned fabric \n\u2013 four bays in one section and five in the other. Each of the nine bays of tensioned \nfabric is clamped on either side to prismatic steel trusses. There are 10 trusses spanning \napproximately 77 metres across the court. Ends of each truss are supported by a set of bogies \nthat move along parallel tracks positioned at either side within the new \u2018fixed\u2019 roof.\nIn preparation for closing the roof, one section is parked in its folded state at the \nnorth end of the court while the other is parked at the south end. The coordinated \nelectro mechanical movement moves the trusses apart and, at the same time, unfolds and \nstretches out the fabric between the trusses over the court until the two sections meet in an \noverlapping seam above the middle of the court.\nThe arch shape to the tops of the trusses helps the structure to withstand their own dead \nweight and loading from elements such as snow and wind when the roof is stretched and \nclosed over the court. The roof has been designed to close in a maximum of 10 minutes. If \nthe roof is being closed for rain, court covers will protect the grass in the usual way while \nclosure is in progress. After the roof has been closed, play can resume after a period of \naround 30 minutes, depending on climatic conditions.\nROOF BY NUMBERS\n8 Litres per second of fresh air per person pumped into the bowl to manage  \n the environment \n9 Chiller units required to cool the air \n10 Minutes (maximum) that the roof takes to close \n10 Trusses holding up the roof \n16 Metres \u2013 height of the roof above the court surface \n30 Minutes \u2013 maximum time expected before play can start/continue after the  \n roof is closed and the internal environment is controlled and stabilised\n43 Miles per hour \u2013 wind speed up to which the roof can be deployed/ retracted\n77 Metres \u2013 the span of the moving roof trusses (width of football pitch = 68m)\n70 Tonnes \u2013 weight of each of the 10 trusses without extra parts\n100 Tonnes \u2013 weight of each of the 10 trusses with all extras \u2013 eg motors, locking  \n arms\n100 Percent of the roof \u2019s fabric which is recyclable \n214 MM per second \u2013 maximum speed of truss deployment \n1,200 Extra seats installed in 2008 \n3,000 Tonnes \u2013 combined weight (both fixed and moving) of the roof\n5,200 Square metres, area of retractable roof when fully deployed \n7,500 Wimbledon umbrellas, needed to cover the same area as the retractable roof\n15,000 Maximum spectator capacity "}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Here are some of the more memorable moments\u2026\n1. In 1949 the match between Hans van Swol (Netherlands) and Bobby Abdesselam \n(France) was held up for a short period when a squirrel appeared on the court. The Ball Boys \njumped into action and chased the little imposter away.\n2. During the 1957 gentlemen\u2019s doubles final, Helen Jarvis invaded the court, shouting and \nwaving a banner in support of her campaign for a new world banking system, called the \n\u2018Life, Love, and Sex Appeal Party\u2019. The message on the banner began with the words \u2018God \nSave Our Queen\u2019 and the rather polite intruder also wore a white hat and flat white shoes \nso as not to damage the grass. Her Majesty The Queen watched from the Royal Box as the \nreferee and a policeman escorted her off. \n3. Britain\u2019s Roger Taylor and Sweden\u2019s Bjorn Borg were both popular with the female fans, \na point proved at the conclusion of their 1973 encounter when schoolgirls ran on to the \ncourt and asked Borg for his autograph. After the police cleared the court, the groundstaff \nstraightened out the turf and made sure there were no heel marks. In a similar vein, 70s \ncrowd favourite Ilie Nastase of Romania obligingly supplied a young girl with an autograph \nwhen she ran on to court during his 1974 match against the Czechoslovkian Jiri Hrebec.\n4. The 1976 match between Americans Jimmy Connors and Stan Smith was interrupted by \npromoters pushing a pop concert, with Connors being handed a single rose.\n5. A 1981 ladies\u2019 doubles match became heated when play was halted at 9.35 p.m. due to \nbad light, with the score poised at 5-5 in the final set. The contest was between Sue Barker \n(GB) and her partner Ann Kiyomura (USA) and JoAnne Russell (USA) and Virginia \nRuzici (Romania).

Shriver, renowned for her volleying skills, swatted them with \nher racket but Rinaldi was stung on the arm. The sting was subsequently removed by her \nconsiderate opponent. \n7.

A year later and another species of bird marked what would become recurrent visits to \nThe Championships 1990 with a first appearance during the match between Germany\u2019s \nBoris Becker and Brad Gilbert of the USA. The pied wagtail clearly enjoyed its time in the \nlegendary arena, returning for some semi-final action with Steffi Graf v Zina Garrison and \nthen Ivan Lendl v Stefan Edberg.\n9. 1991 boasted one of the most unusual interruptions when, at the start of the second set of \nthe final between the German rivals Boris Becker and Michael Stich, a protester claiming to \nbe the American President and brandishing a picture of his daughter briefly disturbed play. \nHe was not George H.W. Bush and he was quickly removed.\n10. 1996 had been a sodden Championships and the crowd were in need of levity. \nImmediately before the gentlemen\u2019s singles final between Richard Krajicek (Netherlands) \nand MaliVai Washington (USA) this was provided by a female streaker \u2013 and sometime \nmember of the catering corps \u2013 who dashed across the lawn in just her pinny. The Club \nlater joined in the fun when it issued a statement regarding the incident: \u201cWhilst we do not \nwish to condone the practice, it did at least provide some light amusement for our loyal and \npatient supporters, who have had a trying time during the recent bad weather.\u201d\n11. A mouse interrupted play in a 1998 match between Russia\u2019s Yevgeny Kafelnikov and \nMark Philippoussis of Australia.\n12. The avian threat returned, in fuller force, in 1999 when a group of pigeons twice \ninterrupted play during the singles match between Boris Becker and his compatriot Nicolas \nKiefer. The rowdy flock disturbed both Becker\u2019s service and his opponent\u2019s concentration.\n13. Later that same year a single pigeon gatecrashed the gentlemen\u2019s singles semi-final \nmatch between the United States\u2019 Pete Sampras and Britain\u2019s Tim Henman, causing the \nlatter to lose his concentration while serving. It is not known if he was part of the previous \nsquadron. \n14. Henman was once again the victim of disturbance in 2002 when, just prior to his match \nagainst the Australian Scott Draper, two pranksters, dressed in whites and carrying rackets, \nclimbed over the barrier and began knocking a ball to and fro over the net. A security guard \nintervention forced the pair off court via the nearest exit.\n15. After the female trailblazer in 1996, a male streaker took his turn at naked invasion \nwhen he danced onto the lawn during the 2002 gentlemen\u2019s singles final between Australia\u2019s \nLleyton Hewitt and David Nalbandian from Argentina. \n16.

In addition to a new fixed and retractable roof, it delivered an \nincreased capacity of 12,345; the replacement of all seats inside the stadium for improved \nspectator comfort; 15 refurbished hospitality suites and various back-of-house areas; a \ntwo-level Walled Garden public plaza; and a living wall either side of the Big Screen facing \nAorangi Terrace.\nA central consideration of the No.1 Court redesign was to ensure that the right shape \nof roof opening was created to maximise the natural light levels on the court to support \nthe growth of the grass, while also trying to give a curved feel to the stadium to reflect the \nhistoric circular design of the No.1 Court.\nThe No.1 Court roof has 11 steel trusses, each weighing 100 tonnes; two more moving \ntrusses than Centre Court due to the larger aperture. Moving each of them onto the No.1 \nCourt required a 600-tonne crawler crane with 300 tonnes of counterweight.\nIn total, the retractable roof requires 164 drives and motors to move it. There are \n200,000 bolts holding the steel structure together and a further 4,500 anchors tying the \nsteel structure to the existing concrete structure. 7500m\u00b2 of fabric was procured for the roof \nassembly \u2013 enough to cover 38 tennis courts \u2013 and the entire project required an average of \n80,000 man hours per month to complete."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Mainly due to major improvement schemes, which added 700 \nseats in 1929, 450 in 1939, 900 in 1955 and 1,250 in 1981, the seating capacity of the court \nincreased to 6,508 when finally used in 1996. The present No.1 Court has a seating capacity \nof 12,345.\nThe original No.3 Court was opened in 1922 and No.2 Court a year later, when \npermanent stands held 1,000 and 1,900 seats respectively. In 1971 a permanent stand \nwas constructed between the original Courts 6 and 7 and in 1997 a permanent stand was \nconstructed beside Court 18. In 2009 the new No.2 Court provided a capacity of over 4,000 \nand No.2\u201311 Courts were renumbered No.3\u201312. In 2011 a new No.3 Court was opened, \naccommodating 1980 spectators. There was also a new Court 4, situated east of No.3 Court, \nwhich seated 170 people on the west side."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

(Aorangi, meaning \u2018Cloud in \nthe Sky\u2019, is the Maori name for Mount Cook.)\nEach year during The Championships a small part of the land was set aside for car \nparking. In 1977 the Tea Lawn was extended into Aorangi Park and a year later the \nboundary of the original ground (North Road) was also extended northwards to line up with \nthe Tea Lawn, so as to allow the construction of the new Debenture Holders\u2019 Lounge and \nfour grass courts. These courts were commissioned in 1980 and numbered 14\u201317. Two years \nlater Aorangi Park was repossessed and brought within the perimeter of the Grounds.\nSport was first played on the ground by the Argyle Athletic Association in 1906. The \nground was used by John Barker Ltd when the Club took adjacent residence in 1922.\n \nBROADCAST AND MEDIA AREAS\n \nThis is the 28th year for the world\u2019s leading broadcasters to use the purpose-built, 5,000 \nsq. metre Broadcast Centre, which was opened in 1997. The Championships 2025 will \nsee \u2018Wimbledon Broadcast Services\u2019 utilise its state-of-the-art hub for content creation, \ntransmission and distribution to produce the host broadcast, as well as host stunning \npresentation positions for broadcast partners to showcase the Grounds after the completion \nof the Media Pavilion Project in 2024.\nThere will be multi-camera coverage from all 18 Courts, produced from over 120 host \ncameras across the site. A combination of manned and robotic camera solutions will be \nutilised, with numbers of courtside cameras ranging from five on some outside courts to 29 \non Centre Court. Each operation has dedicated replay and graphics facilities, a director with \nfull audio and visual support, as well as world feed commentary from up to 11 courts at any \none time. The robotic courts, world feed and media rooms have been upgraded this year to \n1080pHDR which means Wimbledon will be the first Grand Slam to deliver all output in \nthis format resolution. \nDESIGN\nThe top floor of the Broadcast Centre, overlooking Courts 14-18, houses 15 permanent \nBroadcast Studios. The proximity of the presentation positions offers television a more \nintimate atmosphere and a feeling of being more closely involved with play. With the \ncompletion of the Media Pavilion, there are now three different roof levels, offering up to 26 \n\u2018stand-up\u2019 presentation bays, from which rights holders can broadcast.\nPRODUCTION AREAS\nThe two lower floors are dedicated to technical, production and editing rooms, much of the \nbuilding digging deep into the hillside that used to overlook Aorangi Park.\nMCR\nAt the heart of the Broadcast Centre sits the enlarged Master Control Room (MCR), which \nreceives the vision and audio signals from the 18 televised courts, together with over 22 \nbeauty camera feeds, and distributes them to all broadcasters both on and off site.

A new No.1 Court, seating \n11,000 spectators, was sited to the northern edge of the layout and a new No.2 Court was \nplanned at the extreme south. Spectator seats would then be evenly spread over the Grounds \nrather than concentrated in the middle. \nSecondly, the site was arranged to work like a theatre with a \u2018front and back of house\u2019. \nThe re-developed Wimbledon would concentrate visitor access on the east side, and \n\u2018backstage\u2019 access to the west. The character of Wimbledon was conserved and enhanced by \nre-establishing Centre Court as the focal point; a \u2018country house\u2019 in its garden and parkland \nsetting. The considerable amount of new buildings were blended into the landscape  \nas \u2018outbuildings\u2019.\nThe new No.1 Court was an updating of the proven design of Centre Court, circular \nin plan and providing good sightlines, lighting, ventilation and acoustics for players and \nspectators alike. To maintain its status as the \u2018younger brother\u2019 to Centre Court, the \nnew stadium is countersunk into the hillside and surrounded by terraces of restaurants, \nhospitality, retail and service spaces.\n \nTIMING\nSTAGE 1\nThe initial development comprised construction of the new No.1 Court, offering a multitude \nof facilities; a new, largely underground Broadcast Centre; a road tunnel linking Somerset \nRoad with Church Road; two new Courts 18 and 19, cut into the hillside to give flexibility "}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Other improvements included the installation of architectural \nlighting in the Media Theatre, respraying the fa\u00e7ade and the remodelling of the secondary \ninterview room.\nThe No.1 Court Shop, the largest on the Grounds, was completely refurbished. Retail \nspace was increased by 25 per cent through expansion into areas previously taken up by \nstore rooms and corridors and creating new and larger store rooms deeper in the No.1 \nCourt building.\nAs part of the AEL TC\u2019s commitment to be net zero by 2030, it was agreed that there was \na need to commence degassing the estate. This process began in the staff restaurant in Centre \nCourt, with the replacement of all gas kitchen appliances with their electrical equivalent. \nOther projects included replacing the plastic seats on Courts 4, 8 and 18 with the same \nupholstered seats as elsewhere in the Grounds; the installation of cooling systems in the \nIndoor Tennis Centre dressing rooms; refurbishments to The Lookout, the American \nExpress facility to the back of No.3 Court; the replacement of the lift in the south-west \ncorner of Centre Court; the conversion of Aorangi Courts 11 and 13 to hybrid grass courts. \nAway from the main site, the final phase of the Raynes Park project was completed, \nwith the opening of the new pavilion, as well as ancillary buildings and a large new car \npark at the Community Tennis Centre. \nAt Roehampton, a project was undertaken to support a range of improvements to the \nWimbledon Qualifying and Community Sports Centre. This saw a series of accessibility \nupgrades, with the inclusion of ramps and widened staircases to help guests move more \neasily around the grounds; some minor works to the newly refurbished dressing rooms; \nredecoration of the remaining player circulation areas within the pavilion building. The site \nhas also been made ready to accommodate an increase in capacity from 3,000 to 3,500.\n2024-25\nFollowing The Championships 2024, work began on the comprehensive refurbishment, \nbordering on a rebuild, of the Millennium Building. The project is designed to deliver a \nstep change in the Member, player and print media experience at The Championships. This \nproject should be substantially complete by The Championships 2027. The first year of works \nincludes removing the existing roof and upper floor, before re-instating it in new materials \nso that it can be extended upwards in later years. The AEL TC has appointed McAlpine, the \ncontractors on the No.1 Court project, to deliver the Millennium Building project.\nIn April 2025 the AEL TC announced plans to undertake a programme of \nenhancements to The Hill. The enhancement works are scheduled to commence following \nthe conclusion of The Championships 2026 and the new-look Hill will be ready to \nwelcome guests at The Championships 2027.\nThe planned developments will allow far greater accessible viewing opportunities and \nwill transform wheelchair access to The Hill\u2019s various tiers, including the Orchard and \nPergola areas, situated at the top of The Hill. The plans will also deliver more seating \nthrough a number of new low retaining walls which will optimise visibility of the No.1 \nCourt large screen by reducing the gradient of the existing tiers.\nDuring The Championships 2024 and the weeks that followed, the Club identified the \nneed to review its roof maintenance regime and to replace obsolescent mechanical parts. \nThese improvements have been prioritised and will be implemented over the coming years.\nThe AEL TC continues to progress its decarbonisation strategy through replacement of gas \nboilers with immersion heaters, as well as degassing kitchens across the estate. This is being \ncoordinated with wider development plans and the longer-term decarbonisation strategy."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Wimbledon Park Golf Course was reduced from 18 holes to nine holes \nfrom 1 January 2022 and continued as a nine-hole course until 31 December 2022. With \nthe purchase of the 73-acre golf course, the AEL TC Grounds have nearly trebled in size \nfrom the existing 42-acre site.\nThe intention is to utilise this space by building a new stadium, the Parkland Show \nCourt, and 38 grass tennis courts along with new facilities for players. The extra space will \nalso allow the Qualifying Competition to be held on-site rather than at the Wimbledon \nQualifying and Community Sports Centre in Roehampton, as it is now. The project also \ncontains plans to deliver significant benefits for the local community, including a 50 per \ncent increase in publicly accessible green space in the local area for residents to enjoy. \nThe AEL TC proposes to do this by creating 27 acres of parkland, made up of 23 acres \nin the south and four acres in the north (the latter included as part of an addendum issued \non the plans in May 2024). All of the veteran trees on the site will be protected and 1,500 \nnew trees will be planted. The Wimbledon Park Lake will be desilted, a boardwalk created \nand facilities for sailing and angling will be enhanced. Specific areas will be set aside to \ncreate natural habitats for protected species of flora and fauna, both British and European.\nThere will be greater access to The Championships for those living locally with the \nexpansion of the Community Ticket Scheme. Outside of The Championships period, \nlocal community groups will have access to the facilities within the Parkland Show Court \nand the former golf clubhouse.\nIn October 2023, Merton Council\u2019s Development and Planning Committee resolved to \napprove planning permission, but in November 2023, Wandsworth\u2019s Planning Committee \nresolved to refuse permission. Consequently, in January 2024, the Mayor of London\u2019s \noffice decided to call-in the application, meaning that planning officers from the Greater \nLondon Authority (GLA) were required to make their own assessment of the proposals. \nA public hearing, presided over by the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Regeneration, \ntook place in September 2024, at which the planning application was approved.\nA judicial review challenge of the GLA\u2019s decision has been lodged by an opposition \ngroup and will be heard in court in July 2025. In parallel, the All England Club has put a \nseparate legal matter before the court: to establish that there is no statutory trust over the \nland. The All England Club\u2019s position remains that there is not, nor has there ever been, \na statutory trust affecting the former Wimbledon Park Golf Course land, but only the \ncourts can determine this. \nThe AEL TC Wimbledon Park Project team has engaged with more than 10,000 \nlocal residents at more than 100 events and guided tours since the plans were initially \nannounced.\nDetails of the proposals, the consultation process, the planning application, FAQs and \nother information relating to the AEL TC Wimbledon Park Project are available at www.\nwimbledon.com/wpp.\nOverleaf: Computer-generated images of the 27 \nacres of parkland that the AELTC Wimbledon Park \nProject intends to deliver to the local community"}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

From establishing a Gentlemen\u2019s Doubles \nChampionship after Oxford University\u2019s early competition had faltered \nto ushering in the age of Open tennis, The AELTC has always been at the \nvery forefront of the sport, and many of its greatest champions have been \nimmortalised by having courts named in their honour around the world.\n \n \nOPEN TENNIS\n \nThe expansion of air travel in the fifties resulted in a great increase in the number of \nforeign players at Wimbledon and other tournaments throughout the world, but with this \nsurge came an epidemic of what had become known as \u2018shamateurism\u2019 \u2013 the receiving by \namateur players of financial assistance in excess of amounts permitted by the International \nTennis Federation.\nThe need for reform was evident. The initiative came from The All England Lawn Tennis \nClub, led by the then Chairman Herman David, who in late 1959 put forward a proposal to \nThe Lawn Tennis Association that The Championships be made open to all players. In July \n1960 the ITF rejected this move and several years followed in which argument persisted at \nall levels of the game. In 1964 the Club tried to persuade the L TA unilaterally to declare The \nChampionships \u2018open\u2019 but support was not forthcoming.\nIn August 1967 an invitation tournament for men (sponsored by the BBC to mark \nthe introduction of colour television) was held on the Centre Court, with eight players \ntaking part \u2013 all professionals. Most of these players had won honours at Wimbledon in \ntheir amateur days but had forfeited the right to play there on turning professional. The \nsegregation of the two categories was soon to come to an end.\nIn December that year the Annual General Meeting of the L TA voted overwhelmingly \nto admit players of all categories to Wimbledon and other tournaments in Britain. At a \nspecial meeting held in Paris on 30 March 1968, the ITF, faced with a fait accompli, yielded \nand allowed each nation to determine its own legislation regarding amateur and professional \nplayers. Three months later the first Open Wimbledon, offering \u00a326,150 in prize money, was \nstaged. A new era had begun. \n \nOXFORD UNIVERSITY DOUBLES CHAMPIONSHIP (1879\u20131883)\n \nWhen, early in 1884, The All England Lawn Tennis Club decided to add a Gentlemen\u2019s \nDoubles Championship to their programme, the Oxford University Lawn Tennis Club offered \nto transfer their 60 guinea Challenge Cup to the new event. The Committee were pleased to \naccept and agreed that the inscription on the trophy should be altered as little as possible.\nThe O.U.L.T .C. had instituted a gentlemen\u2019s doubles event for the \u2018Oxford University \nChallenge Cup for Pairs\u2019 in 1879 when, at the new Norham Gardens, 14 club pairs \ncontested the matches, each over the best of seven sets.\nThe following year 12 pairs competed, but in 1881 and 1882, when eight pairs \nparticipated, the matches were reduced to the best of five sets. In 1883 the number of \nentries dwindled to six, but due to withdrawals only three matches were played to settle the \nissue. Interest in the event had considerably waned, with the leading players expressing the \nopinion they could not justify spending several days just playing doubles. Consequently the \nuniversity discontinued the tournament."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}

Also, for many years the Wimbledon Programme traditionally \nlisted the champions and runners-up from Oxford.\n \n \nALL ENGLAND CHAMPIONSHIPS\n \nSometimes the title \u2018All England Championships\u2019 is incorrectly given to the events \nat Wimbledon, because of the promotion of the properly named \u2018The Lawn Tennis \nChampionships\u2019 by the All England Lawn Tennis Club.\nHowever, long before the Ladies\u2019 Doubles and Mixed Doubles Championships were \ninaugurated at Wimbledon in 1913, All England Championship titles existed elsewhere. \nThe All England Ladies\u2019 Doubles Championship was held annually from 1884 to 1953 in \nconjunction with the Derbyshire Championships at Buxton and the All England Mixed \nDoubles Championship was held annually from 1888 to 1938 in association with the \nNorthern Championships, staged alternately at Liverpool and Manchester.\nThe ladies\u2019 doubles event from 1899 to 1907 and the mixed doubles event from 1900 to \n1912, held at Wimbledon, both had non-Championship status and were used mainly to \naugment the programme.\n \n \nJUNIOR CHAMPIONSHIPS\n \nThe Junior Wimbledon Championships have been staged on grass during the second week \nof The Championships from 1947 to date, originally as an invitational event, but from \n1975 upgraded to Championship status. Quite often this event is confused with the Junior \nChampionships of Great Britain (under 18), which was staged on the hard courts of The All \nEngland Lawn Tennis Club from 1924 to 1939 and 1946 to 1990 (early September up to \n1981 and April thereafter). From 1970 the event was generally known as the British Junior \nHard Court Championships. The tournament was staged under the management of the \nLawn Tennis Association.\nThe former event is quite often referred to as \u2018Junior Wimbledon\u2019 which is acceptable, but \nto refer to the latter event by the same title is confusing and incorrect.\n \nSUPPORT FOR OTHER EVENTS\n \nFrom 2009, the ATP revised the format of the Tennis Masters Cup, the season finale of the \nATP Tour, to the ATP Finals, a singles and doubles round robin to crown the season-ending \nsingles and doubles champions. Alongside the L TA, the AEL TC lent its support to the bid \nfor London to host the event, and The Championships logo featured on the event collateral. \nThe event was staged at London\u2019s O2 Arena from November 2009 up to November 2020. \nAs one of the four Grand Slams, the AEL TC also contributes to the international \ndevelopment of the sport through the Grand Slam Player Development Programme \n(formerly the Grand Slam Development Fund), with more than $60 million delivered to the \nITF since 1986, to administer the fund on behalf of the Grand Slams.\nThe Programme has helped to provide competitive opportunities in developing tennis \nregions throughout the globe and has also helped talented individuals to succeed where \nfinances may have otherwise proved a barrier to their success."}]}], "generationConfig": {"response_mime_type": "application/json"}}}
